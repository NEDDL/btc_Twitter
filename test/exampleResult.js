          "Whales Transfer BTCs, Extreme Fear in Crypto Community By CoinQuora",
        body: 'Most analysts seem to predict further losses,while some remain optimistic.\n\nTo the dismay of many, the cryptocurrency market is starting to bleed red. Along with all other major cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin has plummeted headfirst. It is down by a staggering 3.34% and is trading at $33,417.47 currently. This means that in one year, the coin\'s price has fallen by 43.0%.\n\nAccording to data from Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index, the coin is currently in "extreme fear" mode. The comments under the Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) post reveal that investors are surprised and upset by this sudden drop in confidence. "Lowest I have seen in years," says one user, while another says, "We are falling."\n\nAnother pessimistic sign is that in the past few hours, BTC is being transferred and liquidated in bulk. Whale Alert posted on Twitter about 1500 BTC being transferred from an unknown wallet to Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN). And in another incident, 12,852 BTC was transferred from an unknown wallet to an unknown wallet.\n\nMoreover, a whopping $320 million has been liquidated from the cryptocurrency market in the past 24 hours, according to WatcherGuru. This is reflective of the falling level of confidence in investors.\n\nInvestors on Twitter don\'t seem pleased with these developments but are still hopeful. "It\'s a bad dream," says one user, while others say, "Adoption is at an all-time high and growing daily" and "Bitcoin will hit $10,000 this year."\n\nRenowned trader Peter Brandt, who has often predicted some of Bitcoin\'s biggest moves, claims that Bitcoin and crypto in general are on the edge of a dot-com-like crash.\n\nHowever, several other analysts, such as William Clemente, say the dip is temporary and that the crypto market will eventually turn back to green. Users will have to wait and watch.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this article are solely the author\'s and do not necessarily reflect the views of CoinQuora.

        title: "Tech Stocks Are Entering an Age of Uncertainty",
        body: 'Facebook, Netflix, Zoom and others are suffering in the markets as investors reassess their lockdown darlings. But they will rise again.\n\nIn the two decades since the dot-com crash, investors have been bracing themselves for another bubble to burst. Yet year after year, tech firms like Facebook and Alphabet Inc. continued to enjoy uninterrupted expansion and unwavering faith among their investors that it would continue. Even the financial crisis of 2008 barely registered as a blip. But now there is serious talk among entrepreneurs and investors that the correction everyone feared might finally be happening.\n\nGiven how intrinsically technology is woven into our lives -- and how it will pioneer new avenues through augmented reality, streaming services, artificial intelligence and more -- the broader tech boom of the past two decades seems set to continue in the long run. But investors for now must navigate something novel: uncertainty. Already the Nasdaq 100 has declined about 23% since November 2021. That is as steep a drop as it experienced in March 2020 with the onset of global Covid-19 lockdowns. If it slides a couple percentage points more, that will mark its biggest decline ever in a single year. So-called FAANG stocks, including Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc., Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google, had on Friday lost roughly $2 trillion in value since the start of the year.\n\nIt\'s worth noting that the markets have never experienced a transition from a global pandemic that made millions of people housebound. There is no historical reference point. Now companies and investors are trying to process an explosion of pent-up demand, where consumers have rushed out of the confines of their homes to buy things in physical stores and plan "revenge travel." The Walt Disney Co. has had more visitors to its theme park in Florida than it did pre-pandemic.\n\nAs companies hurt most by the pandemic see their fortunes swing back into positive territory, tech\'s lockdown darlings are suffering from a reassessment of value that arguably looks overdone for some. Take Spotify Technology SA. On Friday, shares in the music-streaming pioneer were trading at an all-time low of $105, and down 57% since the start of the year, despite just reporting its biggest growth in profit in the last quarter and 15% annual growth in subscribers to 182 million.\n\nZoom Video Communications has lost 45% of its value since the start of 2022, despite steady quarterly net-income growth. Zoom\'s drop seems especially weird given how much businesses continue to use its product for meetings, even as their staff return to offices.\n\nBut while not everyone deserves to suffer from a broader correction, it was bound to happen. Many tech valuations were indefensible. Should Tesla Inc. really be worth more than six times the combined market value of General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co.? And considering that it took nearly four decades for Apple Inc. to reach a market valuation of $1 trillion, should it have taken fewer than four years to hit $3 trillion?\n\nProbably not. Now signs are pointing to a mood shift among tech firms and those who invest in them. Facebook is pausing hiring, a previously unfathomable prospect. The company blamed macroeconomic challenges and Apple\'s privacy changes for its slowest revenue growth in 10 years last quarter. But its falling shares and reputation for causing psychological harm to users of its platforms are also making it harder to attract talented engineers, which Mark Zuckerberg desperately needs to realize his metaverse ambitions. Little wonder the company is treading more cautiously into the metaverse now, having also said it will invest less that it originally intended in virtual reality.\n\nSPACs (remember them?) meanwhile seem to have declined in number, leading to far fewer late-stage exits for tech companies so far this year. Sneer as much as you like at the "blank check" backers of companies that had no business going public -- they likely helped stave off the tech market correction we\'re now witnessing for at least half a year or more.\n\nWith many SPAC investors burned by misadventure, venture capitalists might also be poised to rein in their activity in private markets. One venture capital investor in London said they had seen three different funding deals for tech startups, worth about $5 million each, collapse in the past few of weeks. "These were deals that would have happened three years ago," he said, requesting anonymity because of his involvement in founding a new stealth startup. "Everyone is battening down the hatches."\n\nLayoffs, which history tells us tend to snowball across an industry, are cropping up among tech startups and newly public tech firms: Celebrity shoutout app Cameo said last week that it was cutting nearly 90 jobs; the week before, fintech darling Robinhood Markets Inc. said it would cut about 9% of its 3,400-person workforce.\n\nChances are the current declines aren\'t over, as many of the factors driving the rout -- high inflation, supply chain disruption and that long-time-coming reassessment on value -- promise to stick around. But with technology products plugged so deeply into our daily infrastructure, tech valuations will continue growing for the long haul. This is probably not the precursor to a burst, but a temporary deflation.\n\nThat means equity investors must now contend with a new and unfamiliar era of doubt for tech, while venture capital funds shore up cash to ride out the next couple of years. Startups will have to do the same. It will be painful, but it won\'t last forever.',

          "Bitcoin's Unraveling Hits 50% From Peak With Drop Below $33,000",
        body: "Bitcoin slumped to a level last seen in July 2021, part of a wider retreat in cryptocurrencies triggered by a global flight from riskier investments.\n\nThe world's largest digital token fell as much as 5.1% on Monday and traded at around $32,630 at 10:47 a.m. in New York. Ether fell as much as 7%, while Solana dropped 7.3% and Avalanche dipped 9.4%.\n\nMichael Novogratz, the billionaire cryptocurrency investor who leads Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd., warned that he expects things to get worse before they get better.\n\n\"Crypto probably trades correlated to the Nasdaq until we hit a new equilibrium,\" Novogratz said on Galaxy's first-quarter earnings call on Monday. \"My instinct is there's some more damage to be done, and that will trade in a very choppy, volatile and difficult market for at least the next few quarters before people are getting some sense that we're at an equilibrium.\"\n\nTightening monetary policy to combat runaway inflation and ebbing liquidity are turning investors away from speculative assets across global markets. Adding to the caution around digital assets, the value of TerraUSD or UST, an algorithmic stablecoin that aims to maintain a one-to-one peg to the dollar, slid below $1 over the weekend before recovering.\n\n\"In light of fears of rising inflation, most investors have taken a risk-off approach -- selling stocks and cryptos alike in order to cut down risk,\" said Darshan Bathija, chief executive of Singapore-based crypto exchange Vauld.\n\nBitcoin Breaches Key Level; Do Kwon-Backed Stablecoin Slips\n\nMonday's selloff was widespread across the cryptocurrency universe, with Cardano falling 8.4% and Polkadot down 6.7%, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nRising interest rates are giving individual and institutional investors pause for thought about the crypto market outlook, according to Edul Patel, chief executive officer of Mudrex, an algorithm-based crypto investment platform. Bitcoin's 29% decline in 2022 compares with a retreat of more than 10% in global bonds and shares, and a 2.5% advance in gold.\n\n\"The downward trend is likely to continue for the next few days,\" he said, adding Bitcoin could test the $30,000 level.\n\nBitcoin's recent decline puts it at risk of firmly dropping out of the range where it's been trading in 2022, completely reversing the most recent bull run that drove the token to a record of almost $69,000 in November. With its 40-day correlation with the S&P 500 stock benchmark at a record 0.82, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, any further hit to equities sentiment would risk dragging Bitcoin down as well.\n\nA correlation of 1 means two assets move in perfect lockstep; a reading of -1 means they move in opposite directions.",

          "Mexican Platform Bitso Adjusts Its Strategy in Latin America By DailyCoin",
        body: 'The platform\'s strategy is to entice more users to use its app while improving income in times of inflation.\n\nThe Mexican cryptocurrency exchange Bitso has outlined its strategy to attract more clients in the region by improving the returns on their investments. The company, which became a unicorn last year, offers up to 15% ROI for USD stablecoins, and yields of up to 6% for Bitcoin.\n\nThe new Bitso+ function, which had previously only been enabled for select clients of the platform, can now be used by more than 4 million clients to receive weekly returns dependent on the investments made.\n\nThe investments do not have a minimum required amount, so users can invest anywhere between one dollar and thousands. According to company executives, the cryptocurrency most preferred by users is Bitcoin, but USD stablecoins, the value of which is tied to the dollar, are also popular.\n\n"It is an easier way to understand the benefits of cryptocurrencies," said David Álvarez, head of the Bitso+ program.\n\nÁlvarez explained that customers who sign up for a platform account, and invest in USD stablecoins, will receive a 15% return on the first $1,000. Investments between $1,000 and $20,000 receive a 10% return, while for those investing $20,000 or more, returns are 7% per year.\n\nRegarding investment into Bitcoin, a 6% rate of return is applied for the first 0.4 BTC, and from that amount onwards, the nominal rate applied is 3.5%.\n\n"Stablecoins can be leveraged by our users, they can use them to make payments to the other side of the world in a matter of minutes and it is the way to speak of the current modern financial system," Álvarez said. The executive claims that the company seeks to use the new strategy to help its clients in Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, and Argentina to work better utilize their money. In future, Bitso plans to add other cryptocurrency options to the program.\n\n"Inflation continues to rise globally and especially in Latin America", highlighted Daniel Voguell, CEO and co-founder of the firm. "With this new feature, we are providing a new way to increase your wealth just by having your assets in your Bitso wallet," he emphasized.',

        title: "5 Benefits Of Being A Young Entrepreneur In A Resale Market",
        body: "I share insights gathered from purpose-driven entrepreneurs\n\nThe resale market is booming, and it seems as though everyone wants to get in on the action. From second-hand clothing and pre-owned shoes to used furniture, resale has emerged as one of the biggest shifts in retail in recent years. Young entrepreneurs have the opportunity to benefit from the market change if they learn to innovate, develop resiliency, start investing early, gain capital, and build their network.\n\nSmall business owners rarely get their start in the industry where they create their long-term success. In many cases, these professionals start off by dabbling in other niches such as lawn care services or selling handmade products. People who are taking advantage of the resale market are seeing a new world open up to them as they better understand what it means to be a young entrepreneur and the benefits that come with that.\n\nAs industries like tech, crypto, entertainment, eCommerce, and others continue to grow, there are no signs of innovation ever stopping. There's always something new to try and new products being created. Many of these improvements are coming from young entrepreneurs who got their start in resale markets. The sneaker industry is a great example, with multiple young entrepreneurs making a name for themselves.\n\nAccording to Statista, the worldwide sneakers market is worth more than $85.5 billion in 2022. That number is projected to surpass $102 billion by 2025. While this includes major players like Nike, Adidas, and Puma, many young entrepreneurs are also starting to gain traction in this growing industry as they buy and sell rare or collectible sneakers.\n\nZach Brooker, a 21-year-old student-athlete at the University of Southern California, began dabbling in the resale of designer and trendy sneakers at age 11 when he sold an old pair of throwback Air Jordans with the help of his mother. The process of researching, evaluating, displaying, and selling these shoes appeared to be a one-time accomplishment at the time, but it ultimately changed his life.\n\nDespite his youth, the sale fueled his entrepreneurial fire and swiftly evolved into a high-yield hobby that blossomed into a rich side hustle for Brooker. It was at that point that he discovered something he could do without it feeling like a job, which is the ultimate goal of any entrepreneur.\n\nSelling sneakers could be where a young entrepreneur gets started as they learn to understand business and the growing need for innovation.\n\nAnyone who is an entrepreneur knows it isn't easy, no matter how old you are. Failure is inevitable at one point or another, but it's the determination to push through it that separates successful entrepreneurs from the ones who quit.\n\nResilience is built up over time as a young business owner makes mistakes and learns to adapt through experience. As you experience failure and face rejection, you'll learn how to avoid certain pitfalls in the future and eventually gain confidence in what you know already works. With more experience, things become less about you and more about the outcome of a situation on behalf of a client or customer. Building confidence will lead to success as you continually move forward.\n\nWith the steady rise of inflation, there is no time like the present to begin investing in your future. Building a steady cash flow as a young entrepreneur means you'll have money to invest in everything from the stock market to cryptocurrency and beyond.\n\nAmong the many benefits of getting started younger is that you'll be able to take more risks with your investment portfolio. The bigger the risk, the bigger the potential return.\n\nWhile investing is always risky, there's much less risk involved when you're young. If your investment doesn't work out, you have time to revamp and come up with a different strategy.\n\nThanks to compound interest, the earlier you start, the better your returns will be when you're ready to retire. As long as you manage your portfolio or work with an accountant that manages it well, you won't have to worry as much about what the future holds.\n\nMost young entrepreneurs don't stick to just one thing for the rest of their careers. Many of them end up using the capital gains from their efforts to build new companies and create new products.\n\nElon Musk is a prime example of using capital gains as he has transitioned from starting Zip2 and PayPal to later using funds from those to start SpaceX and Tesla.\n\nWhile there is no set price to start a business, the earlier a young entrepreneur begins their journey, the sooner they can gain capital.\n\nWhen a young entrepreneur sees success early, it's likely their interest in business ownership grows. It could lead them down other avenues as they work to create the same results in new and exciting industries.\n\nOne of the biggest keys to long-term business success is establishing a network of like-minded individuals as well as other people who could provide value. Social networking on platforms like LinkedIn offers free access to connect with other entrepreneurs who have either already created their own success or are on a similar journey to your own. These connections can lead to partnerships, collaborations, and even mentorships. While engaging on LinkedIn can be intimidating, the benefits outweigh the awkwardness.\n\nYoung entrepreneurs have an amazing opportunity to find mentors along their journey to success. Learning from someone who has already done what you're trying to accomplish is a surefire way to follow in their footsteps.\n\nA common suggestion many mentors will offer is to develop multiple content platforms such as a blog or a YouTube channel. These help young up-and-comers gain credibility as business owners and entrepreneurs.\n\nMany entrepreneurs are learning how to become more business savvy through resale industries. Whether you start by selling clothes or a digital offering, there are many advantages that come with beginning your entrepreneurial journey early.",

        body: "Terra's algorithmic stablecoin TerraUST, known more simply as the UST, lost its peg for the second time since Sunday.\n\nIn the course of the past 24 hours, the stablecoin with an 18.1 billion circulating supply dropped in value by more than 27% to an all-time low of $0.6879. The UST has since regained the majority of its value is hovering at around $0.9161 at the time of writing.\n\nThe freefall of the UST occurred amidst a sell-off in the broader crypto market as Bitcoin plunged below $30K, while whole cryptocurrency market's value as a whole dropped by 2.6% to $1.46 trillion.\n\nThis marks the second instance of Terra's algorithmic stablecoin losing stability in the past three days. On Sunday, May 8th, UST briefly dropped for the first time when a single whale dumped $285M worth of TerraUST, causing its price to dip to $0.987, though it swiftly bounced back.\n\nTo keep its stablecoin's 1:1 peg with the U.S. dollar, Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) yesterday announced the lending of $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin. The foundation expects to make Bitcoin the reserve currency for Terra's ecosystem, and also its main stablecoin UST.\n\nContrary to centralized stablecoins like Tether (USDT), TerraUSD is a decentralized algorithmic stablecoin, which maintains its peg to the U.S. dollar through the use of the Terra ecosystem's governance token, LUNA.\n\nThis is made possible through the smart contract-based mechanism by which each new TerraUST stablecoin is minted through the burning of LUNA coins.\n\nThe price of the UST depends on the algorithm that tracks demand for the stablecoin and adjusts its supply accordingly. The protocol feature, called the arbitrage mechanism, incentivizes users to burn LUNA tokens and mint new stablecoins when the price of UST is too high.\n\nOn the other hand, the algorithm also facilitates the opposite action -- the burning of UST stablecoins to mint LUNA when the price of the stablecoin drops. In this way, the protocol feature is helps stabilize UST prices.\n\nLUNA's Price Drops\n\nSince both TerraUST and LUNA are interconnected, the price drop for one reflects in the other.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, Terra's governance token LUNA fell in value by 60% over the past 24 hours, going from $61.24 on Monday 9th, to $24.14 early on Tuesday 10th. LUNA's market capitalization shrank to reflect this, dropping by 48% and sitting at $10,8 billion at the time of writing.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nTerraUST has over 18 billion coins in circulation and is the tenth-largest crypto by market value. If the LFG implements succeeds in its plans to make Bitcoin a reserve asset for the Terra ecosystem, thereby allowing UST holders to redeem stablecoins for bitcoin, the repetition of such situations could have a hefty negatively impact on the entire Bitcoin market.",

        body: "(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin is falling toward levels last seen in July 2021, part of a wider retreat in cryptocurrencies amid a global flight from riskier investments.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe world's largest digital token dropped as much as 2.7% on Monday and was trading at $33,568 as of 8:44 a.m. in London. The second biggest, Ether, shed as much 4.6%. Most of the major virtual coins were under pressure over the weekend and the downbeat mood carried over into Monday. Equities in and Europe also dropped, with Hong Kong's benchmark index slumping 3.8%.\n\nTightening monetary policy to combat runaway inflation and ebbing liquidity are turning investors away from speculative assets across global markets. Adding to the caution around digital assets, the value of TerraUSD or UST, an algorithmic stablecoin that aims to maintain a one-to-one peg to the dollar, slid below $1 over the weekend before recovering.\n\n\"In light of fears of rising inflation, most investors have taken a risk-off approach -- selling stocks and cryptos alike in order to cut down risk,\" said Darshan Bathija, chief executive of Singapore-based crypto exchange Vauld.\n\nBitcoin Breaches Key Level; Do Kwon-Backed Stablecoin Slips\n\nRising interest rates are giving individual and institutional investors pause for thought about the crypto market outlook, according to Edul Patel, chief executive officer of Mudrex, an algorithm-based crypto investment platform.\n\n\"The downward trend is likely to continue for the next few days,\" he said, adding Bitcoin could test the $30,000 level.\n\nThe token would hit its lowest level since July 2021 if it weakens below $32,970. Bitcoin's 27% decline in 2022 compares with a retreat of more than 10% in global bonds and shares, and a 2.5% advance in gold.\n\nBitcoin's recent decline puts it at risk of firmly dropping out of the range where it's been trading in 2022, completely reversing the bull run that drove the token to a record of almost $69,000 in November. With its 40-day correlation with the S&P 500 stock benchmark at a record 0.82, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, any further hit to equities sentiment would risk dragging Bitcoin down as well.\n\nA correlation of 1 means two assets move in perfect lockstep; a reading of -1 means they move in opposite directions.\n\n(Updates with comment from exchange CEO in fourth paragraph.)",

          "Nvidia Fined $5.5M for Hiding Cryptomining Revenue in 2018 By DailyCoin",
        body: "The Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corporation has agreed to pay a penalty of $5.5M for not properly disclosing its revenue from cryptocurrency mining in 2018. The American tech hardware corp received a civil charge for violating the Securities Exchange Act and misleading investors during the 2017-2018 cryptocurrency boom.\n\nNvidia failed to disclose \"that cryptomining was a significant element of its material revenue growth from the sale of its graphics processing units (GPUs) designed and marketed for gaming\", the recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) order stated.\n\nGaming GPUs Were Used to Mine Crypto\n\n2017 witnessed the unprecedented growth of the crypto market, as the prices of digital coins soared to historic highs. The resulting boom of the cryptocurrency mining industry created excessive demand for high-end GPUs, eventually leading to shortages.\n\nAt the time, GPUs were one of the most effective tools for mining digital coins. Their prices reached extreme new highs, and led to Nvidia's market value almost tripling during the crypto-mining boom. As Bitcoin's price crashed in 2018, GPU demand slumped accordingly, leading to a decrease in Nvidia's revenue in the final quarter of 2018.\n\nIn consecutive quarters of Nvidia's 2018 fiscal year, the company reported growth in revenue of its gaming hardware. As later reported by the SEC, Nvidia was aware that the increase in gaming GPU sales was largely caused by cryptocurrency mining hype. Despite this fact, Nvidia failed to disclose these significant earnings, which were associated with the volatile industry, to its customers, as it was required to do.\n\nInvestors accused Nvidia of falsely reporting that the demand for GPU came from gamers, not cryptocurrency miners. According to them, Nvidia claimed that the reduced demand from crypto miners would not negatively impact its business. As a result, the decline witnessed in Nvidia's revenue and stocks in 2018 led investors to record losses, who later launched a class-action lawsuit against the company.\n\nAccording to the current SEC order, Nvidia misled customers by providing information about its growing gaming business, without also disclosing the fact that other aspects of the company's business were being driven by demand for digital currencies. Nvidia therefore created the impression \"that the company's gaming business was not significantly affected by cryptomining.\"\n\nNvidia has reportedly agreed to a \"cease-and-desist\" order, and will pay a $5.5 million fine. The SEC has not provided any further details on the terms by when the penalties will be carried out.",

        title: "Can StarSharks escape its death spiral?",
        body: "StarSharks fell from first to third place among games on the BNB Chain, with WAU falling off a cliff by 455%. Clearly, StarSharks, an up-and-comer on BSC, has failed to sustain its strong growth.\n\nDespite a slew of updates, data from Footprint Analytics shows that, instead of going to the moon, the project now finds itself at a very dangerous juncture.\n\nAn update on the membership program was approved in a proposal vote completed on the last day of March. The team has provided more application scenarios for veSSS in order to reward SSS stakers and encourage external promotion.\n\nThe update narrows the scope of players who can create invite links to only eligible StarSharks Affiliates. This proposal specifies that only those with 10,000+ veSSS can create invite links.\n\nOn April 6, the output of SEA was reduced by canceling daily tasks and slot machines. In terms of consumption, by expanding the difference in output of shark levels and increasing the number of tokens needed to upgrade. Players are encouraged to consume more tokens while upgrading sharks.\n\nThe Footprint Analytics data shows that the ratio of the growth rate of new users to the growth rate of token issuance is less than 1 most of the time, which means that the number of token issuances is completely outpacing the rate of new users coming in. This has led to an overwhelming number of SEAs, and the token price has been oscillating down.\n\nFootprint Analytics - The Ratio of News Users Change and Daily Issue Change\n\nThe team also saw the inflation of SEA and started to control its output, but this led to less revenue for players and a drop in the number of daily active and new users.\n\nFootprint Analytics - Daily Users\n\nThis update has had a noticeable effect on shark NFT issuance, which has turned to negative daily issuance, and total issuance has started to shrink. Controlling the NFT throwdown will maintain the price of sharks and allow players to synthesize more sharks to burn more SEA, so the price of SEA and NFT will need to be pulled up at the same time.\n\nFootprint Analytics - Daily & Total NFT Supply -StarSharks\n\nOn April 7, adding the claim SEA condition restricts the circulation of SEA and slows down players' mining and selling to empty out the token price. Added NFT escrow feature, users can let the platform escrow their NFT to earn SEA by holding veSSS, encouraging players to hold more NFT and SSS.\n\nThe revenue earned by players is locked, making token holders even less active. The fact that players can earn revenue through escrow without costing time, makes it seem less like a game and more like DeFi, which further reduces player activity.\n\nFootprint Analytics - Token Holders Trend\n\nOn April 7, the StarSharks team burned all of the revenue reserved for 91.43 million SEAs, expecting to pull back the declining SEA prices caused by overproduction.\n\nStarSharks Twitter\n\nSEA's total circulation dropped instantly from 127 million to 37 million after the burn, and it seems that the price of the token didn't help, but kept falling.\n\nFootprint Analytics - Daily Issue vs Token Price\n\nThe removal of the rental marketplace from StarSharks after April 8 caused a huge impact.\n\nAs shown by Footprint Analytics, StarSharks D1 retention was previously high, and the removal of the rental marketplace and daily tasks had a significant impact on retention and new users.\n\nFootprint Analytics - Active Users vs D1 Retention\n\nBut for StarSharks, canceling the rental market was a necessity. Rental is a double-edged sword that can lower the barrier to attract more new players, just as StarSharks' rapidly rising number of users did in the previous period. However, the rental model also has hidden dangers. There is no KYC on the blockchain, which is a problem unable to distinguish the player's identity.\n\nGold farming is a term that refers to the act of playing games constantly to get tokens under the organization of a game guild. Unlike regular players or investors, they mint NFTs and play games with them to gain native tokens for profit. This in turn makes causes wild price fluctuations. This is enabled by rental markets lowering the threshold for users to enter the game. With rental markets, gold farmers can enter the game at low cost, which caused game tokens to be minted and sold to the market in large quantities, so that the token price accelerated the decline.\n\nData from Footprint Analytics shows that the SEA-BNB pairs on PancakeSwap were already trending towards selling SEA at the beginning of March. By the end of March the balance of the pool was broken and the pool was stockpiled with more and more sold SEAs. Such a large sell-off kept pushing the price of SEAs downwards.\n\nFootprint Analytics - SEA-BNB Buy Sell Pressure\n\nAfter the token price and new users continued to go down, the team updated the proposal for the special treasure box launch on April 18.\n\nWhen the new treasure box (Box B) goes live, the old treasure box (Box A) will only mint 1-star sharks, and the daily sale quantity will be dynamically adjusted. Box B is priced at 1000 SEA and will have a chance to get 1 to 6-star sharks, fragments of 7 star sharks, honor points and other items.\n\nThe new shark burning mechanism will give players Box B and lucky points for burning the corresponding level and number of sharks, which will encourage players to buy boxes.\n\nBox B was designed to curb SEA inflation in terms of the number of sharks, but it just went live and it looks like players aren't paying for it, still not pulling SEA consumption in the first few days and the token price keeps falling.\n\nFootprint Analytics - SEA Daily Mint & Burn\n\nStarSharks cut off the two highlights that had allowed it to climb rapidly (the rental system and the invitation mechanism) after a series of adjustments, after which the project fell apart and the token price dropped.\n\nAfter the update, SEA is still not burning enough, and has fallen to $0.1 SEA. New players can not see the hope of profit, leaving only old players struggling to support. The output of the new blind box is more suitable for big players to play PVP, and the survival space for newcomers and retail players becomes even narrower.\n\nStarSharks' cancellation of the rental marketplace was an attempt to stop gold farmers, but it looks like the team is not ready for a reshuffle of this magnitude. The project is still working hard to try to turn things around, and users can directly monitor whether StarSharks can accelerate the SEA burn in the coming days and get new users back or not.\n\nThis piece is contributed by Footprint Analytics community.\n\nThe Footprint Community is a place where data and crypto enthusiasts worldwide help each other understand and gain insights about Web3, the metaverse, DeFi, GameFi, or any other area of the fledgling world of blockchain.

Opinions expressed are those of the author.\n\nTariq Akbar, CEO of LegalEase, helps lawyers use technology and outsourcing to improve organizational performance.\n\nThe growing popularity of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and digital asset transactions, like virtual real estate, signals a growing legitimization of metaverse-based transactions and ecosystems. The metaverse, potentially an $800 billion market, entails complex, environment-specific rules that developers must consider as they assess the best ways to standardize these environments into the proposed Web 3.0 infrastructure.\n\nWith the addition of live events and social ads, this market can potentially double. Businesses need to be mindful of numerous considerations when building their metaverse initiatives to ensure their programs are managed within the company's risk frameworks.\n\nPrivacy\n\nThe metaverse can pose greater privacy risks than current social media platforms. Whether you're playing around in Sandbox or exchanging ADA for Pavia land plots, metaverse environment owners record your purchases on third-party blockchains or databases.\n\nWhile blockchain offers the asset protection of a decentralized system, individually-identifiable information can be gleaned from public blockchain records. Meta's Oculus headsets, for example, save a rolling buffer of your interactions with users in Horizon Worlds that Meta employees can tap into when investigating complaints.\n\nCopyright Issues\n\nIP issues can naturally be at play in a cross-border environment such as the metaverse. Cybercriminals can potentially create digital twins of assets and, without underlying blockchain tech to protect them, exploit these assets.\n\nNFT stores are growing exponentially, and copyright infringement is hard to track and identify. Coach recently pursued a pop-up shop version of this retail concept, albeit legally, with The Walt Disney Company and Keith Haring. Since the identities of plot owners in blockchain-based lands are anonymized, IP owners could struggle to hold infringers accountable. Often, the severest of penalties typically involve having the foundation or DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) in charge block user access to the platform.\n\nOnline Dispute Resolution Obstacles\n\nMany metaverse environments are in growth mode and are more focused on building their user bases and gaining traction than resolving user-to-user disputes. Should a user-to-user conflict arise, parties also have no centralized framework, judicial system or avenue to pursue resolution. Jurisdiction, especially in the metaverse, can be easy to hide and validate because of anonymity issues due to the level of transaction masking made possible by blockchain-based ledgers.\n\nUntil there is a centralized online regulatory authority and jurisdictional framework to govern metaverse-related disputes, companies and authorities must assess how to best implement rules and restrictions.\n\nUnstable, Speculation-Driven Metaverse Economies\n\nMany blockchain-driven metaverse economies rely on cryptocurrency usage. Decentraland users will likely compile LAND tokens, while Sandbox users will do the same with SAND. While cryptocurrencies and decentralized tokens have their perks -- anonymity, the absence of a centralized authority, transaction masking and the like -- they are still speculative investments that major government institutions do not back.\n\nAs a result, unpredictable near-term fluctuations in cryptocurrency demand and supply can disrupt the stability of metaverse-centered economies and undermine NFT-based real estate mortgages and asset class purchase values in the short term. As cryptocurrencies start to stabilize over the long term, some of this may change.\n\nSo, how can companies mitigate their liability for metaverse-related activities?\n\nFocus\n\nTo start, companies should form a metaverse-focused task force responsible for developing self-governing ethical, metaverse-centered frameworks. These teams should select focus groups within their respective organizations to assess the viability and evolutionary potential of those standards. Chief risk officers and chief legal officers can be ideal voices to rely on for such matters. Participants in other ethics-driven professions, including chief medical officers, can also offer unique insights.\n\nRisk Frameworks\n\nYour finalized frameworks and focus group input should help your organization structure pertinent team-wide training measures. Many underestimate the amount of education and knowledge required to fully grasp how the metaverse works and how transactions in these environments should operate, including the ethical issues that can evolve from collecting and handling biometric data, AR advertising and the like.\n\nMetaverse-focused teams, therefore, should ensure that employees have access to robust modules, online document repositories and tutorials with in-house and outside experts. Transaction management and monitoring, along with R&D initiatives, will also play a key role in helping your company adapt to dynamic metaverse developments. As the metaverse continues to evolve at a fast clip, organizations must develop frameworks or secure strategic partnerships to report on market developments and maximize the value of their metaverse transactions and activities.\n\nTraining\n\nCompanies must plan and implement substantial training to make sure their metaverse activities do not facilitate risk. While organizations will likely need to push for unified regulatory standards with the DAOs, foundations and for-profit companies engaging in the space, there are still steps that companies can pursue internally to mitigate their risks.\n\nThe metaverse holds great potential and opportunity for companies, so long as they approach it with the right planning and risk management. By focusing on risk frameworks, ethics and education, businesses can better navigate the moving targets within the metaverse.\n\nForbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.

        title: "Instagram to start testing NFTs with select creators this week",
        body: 'Instagram head Adam Mosseri announced today that the platform is going to start testing NFTs with select creators in the United States this week. Mosseri noted that there will be no fees associated with posting or sharing a digital collectible on Instagram. At launch, the supported blockchains for showcasing NFTs on Instagram are Ethereum and Polygon, with support for Flow and Solana coming soon. The third-party wallets compatible for use will include Rainbow, Trust Wallet and MetaMask.\n\nCreators and people who are part of the test can now share NFTs that they\'ve made or that they\'ve bought. You can share these NFTs in your main Feed, Stories, or in messages. Mosseri outlined that only a limited number of people have access to the test, but the company plans to roll out more functionality related to NFTs in the future once it gets feedback from its initial testing.\n\n"I want to acknowledge upfront that NFTs and blockchain technologies are all about distributing trust and distributing power," Mosseri said in his announcement. "But Instagram is fundamentally a centralized platform, so there\'s a tension there. So one of the reasons why we\'re starting small is we want to make sure that we can learn from the community. We want to make sure that we work out how to embrace those tenets of distributed trust and distributed power, despite the fact that we are, yes, a centralized platform. We do think that one of the unique opportunities we have to to make Web3 technology accessible to a much broader range of people. And NFTs specifically we think will be interesting not only to creators who create NFT art, but also to people who want to collect it."\n\nMosseri also noted that the creator economy is incredibly important to Instagram, but that one of the challenging things the company is looking at is how although there are currently a number of different ways for creators to make money, a lot of them are unpredictable and changing rapidly. Mosseri said this new launch will create an interesting opportunity for a subset of creators.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in an announcement that similar functionality will be coming to Facebook soon, and possibly to other Meta apps in the future. Zuckerberg also said Meta is going to work on augmented reality NFTs, or 3D NFTs, that you can bring to Instagram Stories using Spark AR, which is the company\'s software AR platform.\n\nImage Credits: Instagram\n\nAlexandru Voica, EMEA tech comms at Meta, said in a separate announcement that "in the metaverse, people will buy, use, and share digital goods and experiences, and NFTs are a key piece of the puzzle for making this a reality."\n\nVoica went on to note that Meta is starting with NFTs because they are an important aspect of the economic potential of the metaverse, but that they are just one example of the technologies that the company is exploring. Voica said that Meta is exploring a wide range of Web3 technology because the company believes these technologies will reduce costs, expand access and accelerate innovation for creators and people around the world.\n\nThe official launch comes a few weeks after Zuckerberg said in a conversation at SXSW that Meta would be introducing NFTs to Instagram soon, which is one of the reasons why today\'s announcement isn\'t exactly a surprise. In addition, last summer, Instagram hosted "Creator Week," an invite-only virtual summit that the company characterized as a "private event for NFT creators" in its invitations.\n\nInstagram\'s NFT test comes as Twitter enabled NFT profile pictures for premium users earlier this year. Instagram and Twitter aren\'t the only digital giants looking to embrace NFTs, as YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki suggested that the platform may embrace web3 technologies, including NFTs, as a means of helping YouTube creators make money.',

        title: "Exploring The Galaxy Of Fintech Services Within The Metaverse",
        body: "AR, VR, AI, IoT and blockchain are advancing fast. Similarly, their penetration into our daily lives, too, is increasing rapidly. They are being used across healthcare, manufacturing, fintech, hospitality, customer service, and many more industries. Looking at how things are, these technologies can significantly enhance the services offered in these various sectors. For example, the future of fintech can be transformed completely by using VR for conducting virtual meetings by financial institutions and enabling customers to pay for products virtually, forgoing the need to step out of your home.\n\nHowever, one application of these technologies that has everyone excited is the metaverse. Metaverse promises a universe beyond our real world. It's a place where our real world, augmented reality, and virtual reality intersect. The intersection gives birth to an interactive, immersive, and collaborative shared virtual 3D environment.\n\nIn addition to these, the metaverse is based on AI, ML, IoT, and blockchain technologies. Metaverse is not a new concept. The word 'metaverse' can be traced back to 1992. However, its implementation and popularity have only risen in recent years.\n\nTech giants like Microsoft, Google, Meta (formerly Facebook), Nvidia, and Unity Software have already made huge investments in the metaverse projects. They are betting on it to become the next big thing!\n\nHow Will the Metaverse Impact the Future of Fintech?\n\nDigital or fintech solutions are already transforming how transactions are carried out in real life. Cashless transactions are already on the rise, and these will form the basis of financial transactions carried out in the metaverse.\n\nThe metaverse will provide a world where people can buy and sell things in real estate, manufacturing, textile and others through digital currencies. This will form the backbone of the huge economic metaverse ecosystem. And this is no distant future we are talking about. It's happening now. For example, the metaverse real-estate firm Republic Realm has already paid $4.3 million for a plot of land in the virtual world Sandbox.\n\nHere's a look at some fintech services applications in the metaverse:\n\nEvery transaction on the Metaverse will be carried out using cryptocurrencies. They are already being used in the real world for the same purpose and are recognized as legal tenders in many countries across the globe.\n\nBased on blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies offer better security, simplify transactions, reduce settlement times and provide better private transactions. Thus, it wouldn't be a surprise that cryptocurrencies become the official payment method in the metaverse and eliminate the use of dollars, pounds or rupees to carry out financial transactions entirely.\n\nHowever, we will have to see how each cryptocurrency performs in the metaverse and which becomes the preferred and standard choice for carrying out transactions (like the US dollar in the real world).\n\nThe metaverse wallet is similar to the current digital wallets offered by financial institutions. The only difference is that metaverse wallets will help you store cryptocurrencies. The wallet can be used for carrying out financial transactions as you do in real life. For example, the metaverse wallets can be used to buy and sell products, like NFTs or virtual real-estate, on the metaverse platform. Similarly, it can also be used for receiving or transferring tokens between users within the metaverse.\n\nThe future of fintech services can help improve financial literacy among individuals. Banks and other financial institutions can use gamification for the same. For example, banks can help their customers with real-world financial decisions in the virtual world by recreating those scenarios in the metaverse through gamification modules. This can help boost financial literacy while eliminating the risks with real, hard-earned money.\n\nMany banks and fintech services are already starting to explore this arena. For example, the online banking services provider Ally has already created a game called Fintropolis. The game helps players understand various financial concepts like budgeting, taxation, investing, stock trading and even buying properties. The game is currently targeted towards the younger generation (high-school students). It aims to provide them with the knowledge and confidence they'll require in the future regarding financial matters. The metaverse will see various fintech service providers developing similar apps to attract and retain customers.\n\nThe metaverse can also enhance the user experience of financial service professionals. The pandemic has led to the adoption of remote work, limiting the interaction and socializing between employees. The metaverse provides a workaround for that. Financial institutions can create a virtual office in the metaverse where the employees' digital avatars can work in a simulated real-world environment. Employees can talk, interact and hang out with each other in the metaverse, much like the real world.\n\nMoreover, banks and other fintech services businesses can hold virtual meetings in the metaverse. They can also use the metaverse for new employee onboarding and carry out associated activities like training them. For example, Hana Bank recently held a commencement ceremony on their metaverse platform for their newly-inducted employees. Similarly, NH NongHyup Bank held an award ceremony and opened a virtual branch on a metaverse platform.\n\nThe future of fintech services in the metaverse seems exciting. However, banks and other financial institutions will have to make quick investments in the digital economic ecosystem of the metaverse if they want to succeed on the platform and be future-ready. That being said, the ROI will take a long time, and fintech services should be prepared for it while the metaverse is in its nascent stages.",

        body: "Arianee has raised a $21 million Series A round (€20 million) in a round led by Tiger Global. The company issues digital ownership and authenticity certificates on behalf of partner brands.\n\nFor instance, a luxury and fashion brand can replace the authenticity card that you get with your new watch or handbag with a digital certificate. As those certificates are non-fungible tokens, you can know for sure that there's only one NFT for this specific good with this serial number and activation date.\n\nAnd, of course, if you want to sell your good, you can also prove the authenticity to the buyer and transfer the certificate to another owner. A certificate isn't tied to your name or email address. Customers get a wallet address and stores their certificates in their wallet.\n\nArianee customers can then leverage these certificates for other purposes. When people download the Arianee app and add the digital passport to their smartphone, brands get a new channel to reach their customers.\n\nYou may have noticed that NFTs have become quite trendy over the past year. Arianee plans to take advantage of that as well with support for airdrops, metaverse deployments and cool in-app visualizations.\n\nIt integrates with their CRM and gives more information about second-hand customers. Brands can also have their own white-label app or integrate Arianee's features in their own apps to control the experience.\n\nCustomers include Printemps, Breitling, Groupe Casino, Vacheron Constantin, Paris Fashion Week, Panerai and IWC.\n\nIn addition to Tiger Global, existing investors Bpifrance, ISAI, Noia Capital and Cygni Labs are also participating in today's round. Commerce Ventures and Motier Ventures are also investing in Arianee as first-time investors.\n\nInterestingly, this isn't a traditional equity round. Investors are buying shares in the startups, but also $ARIA20 tokens. Those tokens power the open source protocol behind Arianee's NFTs. Behind the scenes, Arianee relies on the main Ethereum blockchain and a side-chain called the POAnetwork.\n\n\"We are thrilled to welcome one of the most influential global investors to our journey and to see our historical partners continue to back us,\" co-founder and CEO Pierre-Nicolas Hurstel said in a statement. \"The structure of the investment in both equity & $ARIA20 token shows how a diverse global range of investors, from Bpifrance to Tiger Global, is willing to invest on open source and SaaS web3 solutions. Web3 is eating the world and we believe brands can leverage this revolution to regain control of their digital presence.\"",

        title: "Council Post: The Keys To Unlocking A New World Of Work",
        body: "The Covid-19 pandemic provoked a profound societal reorganization affecting the way we work and live. Overnight, everyday activities we took for granted ceased and the labor market was upturned. The forced surge in remote working across the globe -- with 48% of workers in Europe working remotely at least part of the time during the early stages of the pandemic -- has brought about many changes. Workers are reevaluating the role that work plays in their lives and questioning whether a more flexible approach or reduced working hours may suit them better.\n\nAs the acute phase of the pandemic becomes a distant memory, workplaces are beginning the process of returning to normal. However, that normal is irrevocably changed. This new normal has spurred a conversation on what we want the labor market to look like and the overall state of workers' rights, including whether we need a four-day workweek and remote or hybrid work.\n\nThere has been a profound change in our relationship with work; we must seize the opportunity to build a new work world founded on the principles of social protection and well-being.\n\nTo make that happen, here are three key considerations to getting it right.\n\n1. Flexible work is here to stay, but it's not everyone's priority.\n\nFlexible work is now here to stay and the available talent landscape has fundamentally shifted, with a McKinsey study showing that \"[m]ore than 20 percent of the workforce could work remotely three to five days a week as effectively as they could if working from an office.\"\n\nThis means that the talent pool available to companies has increased, but it also means that workers can now easily apply for a wide array of opportunities and identify those that best match their needs.\n\nYet, workers do not want flexibility at all costs. They value the protection and safeguarding of their rights. Recognizing this, the EU is increasingly framing itself as a leader in regulatory development. In 2021, the EU proposed measures that would regulate platform work and minimize the chances for workers to fall through the cracks. Digital platforms operating from the U.S. have argued against the scope of these proposals, indicating that their business models may crumble if these regulations are enforced.\n\nIn the long run, U.S.-based businesses may need to adjust their business models significantly in the EU and ward off similar regulations in the U.S.\n\n2. The labor market must be re-humanized if we are to truly overcome its structural flaws.\n\nWith 41% of the global workforce considering leaving their employers within the next year and 69% of employers reporting difficulties in hiring, I believe the increasingly stark mismatch between employers' and job seekers' expectations is a major factor in what has been dubbed the Great Resignation. This phenomenon has swept both the EU and the U.S., with workers seeking more flexibility and opportunities that better match their needs.\n\nIt is critically important that skill shortages be addressed and the process of matching workers and employers be made as easy and efficient as possible. While this is undoubtedly a challenge, it also presents an opportunity to re-humanize the labor market and address the driving factors of what should have been called the Great Mismatch rather than the Great Resignation.\n\nWhile the pandemic reinforced the desire for more flexibility in some regions, it has highlighted the inherent vulnerabilities of many workers in other parts of the world. It is estimated that over 60% of all workers worldwide work in the informal economy and are thus unable to avail themselves of their full rights. We must look to develop and provide the necessary layer of protection for those at risk of forced and bonded labor. By acting responsibly and upholding ethical standards, a safe pathway to employment can be ensured.\n\nFrom social protection to support schemes, there are many experts and tools offering innovative and dynamic solutions to help overcome problems affecting the workforce. These include digital solutions such as blockchain and artificial intelligence.\n\n3. Learning doesn't end in school; workers have a lifelong right to training and access to new opportunities.\n\nStudies have shown that during periods with tight employment markets, such as the one we are currently experiencing, employers de-emphasize degrees and focus instead on demonstrated skills and competencies. This is a perfect opportunity for workers to make use of training and reskilling programs to transition into new roles and industries.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the private employment industry helped address glaring gaps in the workforce by training and placing workers operating in essential sectors such as healthcare and the construction industry. Agency workers in many countries have taken advantage of training opportunities, with the highest percentages appearing in Japan (100%), the U.S. (84%), Canada (84%) and Mexico (58%).\n\nCareer management has also been in high demand during the pandemic. Expert advisors offered vital support to companies that needed to restructure and to workers who required guidance to land new opportunities during periods of transformation and uncertainty.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has impacted every person across the globe and changed society forever. It has led to talent shortages, more demand for flexible work and better consideration for work-life balance.\n\nCultivating a workplace culture that ensures training and internal talent mobility can help organizations thrive. Career management firms especially can play a supportive role for organizations. Moreover, by incorporating learning management systems, businesses can stimulate a long-term learning culture and renew investment and interest from leaders and managers. Data show that 80% of HR leaders believe that increased talent mobility leads to significant benefits including higher retention, greater career satisfaction and better culture fit.\n\nWe must work toward the development of a fair and resilient labor market for every worker across the world and ensure that today's challenges are a distant memory in tomorrow's workplace.\n\nForbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.

        body: "Some altcoins can contribute to creating a new bottom in the next few months.\n\nThe entire cryptocurrency market is down by 4.80% over the last day. Likewise, according to the news published by CoinQuora, some experts believe that the crypto market crash will happen in the coming months.\n\nIn addition, Ash WSB, a crypto trader, posted a graph on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) of the total altcoins market for the year 2018/19 vs. 2022/23.\n\nTrend says we are following the same cycle in altcoins as Bitcoin. In this case, we can see a very slow market for the next 9 months. Take the exit from altcoins positions with every pump. Many altcoins can make a new bottom in the next 9-12 months.\n\nTo clarify, all other cryptocurrencies apart from Bitcoin are referred to as altcoins. Now, a huge number of great players in the market are showing keen interest in altcoins.\n\nTo name a few, here are some of the altcoins that can contribute to making a new bottom in the next few months.\n\n1. Cardano\n\nCardano is third-generation crypto. Its features offer the best blends of first and second-generation cryptos, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. It uses Proof of Stake (PoS), enhancing its sustainability compared to other cryptosystems.\n\n2. Shiba Inu\n\nShiba Inu is another meme coin that is also one of the biggest competitors of Dogecoin. The community has also formed an NFT project around SHIB that has enabled it to gain more interest from investors.\n\n3. Decentraland\n\nDecentraland is the virtual reality game token built on the Ethereum blockchain. It has been described as a 3D virtual world where users buy land to create and monetize content, and buy goods and services.\n\n4. Solana\n\nSolana fits up well with Ethereum in two critical areas for development, speed, and low transaction costs. It has enticed many crypto investors due to its revolutionary qualities.\n\n5. Terra\n\nTerra (LUNA) carries a lot of advantages in the market. The network presents competitive programmable payments, logistics, and an infrastructure created to simplify dApp and stablecoin development.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this article are solely the author's and do not necessarily reflect the views of CoinQuora.

        title:
          "Unstable Stablecoin: How Crypto's Crash Broke The Buck For TerraUSD",
        body: "I write about how digital assets are going to change the world\n\nCrypto critics who believe that the industry is nothing more than a series of intricate ponzi schemes are puffing their chests today.\n\nTerraUSD (UST), a digital token with a $16 billion market capitalization that is designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the dollar, known as a stablecoin, nosedived over the past 24 hours. Its price fell below $.65, before somewhat recovering to $0.93 as of this writing. In other words, UST failed spectacularly at the one thing that it was supposed to do - maintain parity with the dollar.\n\nThe episode is reminiscent of when the Reserve Primary Fund, a money market mutual fund with $68 billion in assets fell from $1 per share net asset value to $0.97 during the financial crisis after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in 2008. It owned Lehman commercial paper and the investment bank's collapse caused a panic among money market fund holders who rushed to redeem shares. Money market funds were thought to be as safe as FDIC-insured savings accounts.\n\nIn terms of TerraUSD, the drop happened to fall on the same day that the Federal Reserve issued its biannual Financial Stability Report, in which stablecoins featured prominently. The report noted how stablecoins can be subject to runs on money market funds, especially during times of stress when the assets backing these tokens can become illiquid.\n\nSo what exactly happened with UST? To begin, it is important to note what makes the asset unique, or dangerous, within the world of stablecoins. UST is an algorithmic stablecoin, which means that it operates in a different way than most similar assets. More popular stablecoins, such as tether (USDT - $82 billion market cap) and USD Coin (USDC - $50 billion market cap), are backed by assets such as fiat dollars in a bank account, treasuries, or short-term commercial debt. This approach is also dangerous since issuers have at times been opaque about the exact breakdown of their reserves, USDT has been especially controversial, and watchers are concerned that these assets may not have enough liquid collateral to redeem the $100+ billion in assets that they support.\n\nThat said, those appear to be a paragon of stability when compared to UST. Instead of being backed 1:1 by tangible assets at a bank or custodian, UST uses a complicated setup with another token, LUNA, to try and maintain its peg. LUNA is a native token of the Luna blockchain, a decentralized platform like Ethereum that can run various types of applications like decentralized finance programs (trading and lending) and support non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Every UST is supposed to be redeemable for $1 worth of LUNA, currently priced at $30.00\n\nOf course prices fluctuate just like in the fiat world. The exchange rate for a dollar against other currencies adjusts on a daily basis. In UST's world, LUNA is supposed to be a stabilizing mechanism to help return the price of UST back to $1 when it deviates. If UST falls below $1, there would be an arbitrage opportunity to buy a UST for say $.98 and then trade it for $1 worth of LUNA. Eventually this trade should bring the price back into sync.\n\nThe system seems elegant on paper and a clever bit of financial engineering, but it is unproven. There have been multiple unsuccessful attempts in the past to create an algorithmic stablecoin. For instance, about a year ago a token backing up the stablecoin IRON, called TITAN, dropped to zero amidst market uncertainty in what the team called \"the world's first large-scale crypto bank run.\"\n\nIt looks like Luna tried to learn from these failures, and concerns that some purchasers may worry about LUNA's underlying value, so it also bought over $3 billion worth of Bitcoin and Avalanche as a further stabilizing mechanism for the protocol.\n\nLast weekend, UST started to deviate from $1 as macro uncertainty continued to mount in the light of the 50bps rate increase on Wednesday, concern about April's inflation numbers, released tomorrow, and the double-digit dips impact most crypto tokens in recent days. There were some allegations that an unknown actor was trying to flood the market with UST to attack the protocol, and one pseudonymous actor even took out a very public $10 million short position against the asset.\n\nAs all of this was happening, over $5 billion worth of UST was being drained out of the Anchor Protocol, a DeFi lending application that runs on Luna. This represents about a third of the entire market capitalization, which could be seen as a vote of no-confidence in the asset. This was bound to happen at some point anyway. Participants in this protocol had been receiving an unsustainable 20% yield on their hold, which is abnormally high, even for crypto. Eventually this was going to unwind.\n\nAs you can see above the ball of yarn started to unwind over the weekend, and even when the Luna team deployed all of the bitcoin at hits fingertips, as well as hundreds of millions of dollars in UST to market makers in an effort to bootstrap liquidity and brings things back to an equilibrium, it has not recovered. It may never, and even if it does the reputational damage will be almost impossible to overcome.\n\nIf that was not enough, the collateral damage was extensive. LUNA saw its market capitalization drop from over $30 billion to $10 billion in the past five days and its price is down 64% over this time frame. Additionally, because the team flooded the market with bitcoin in an effort to protect the price peg, it added further selling pressure to that asset, seeing it drop below $30,000 for the first time since last July. In total, crypto's market cap has lost about $300 billion in the past few days.\n\nIf there is one saving grace here, it could be that the other major stablecoins such as USDT and USDC have largely managed to avoid damage themselves. However, as they continue to grow in size, it is fair to assume that regulatory scrutiny will only grow in light of these events.\n\nIt is also fair to wonder if or when there will ever be a successful algorithmic stablecoin. UST surged in no small part due to backlash among crypto natives to the centralized way in which USDT and USDC operate, which they see as anathema to crypto's ideals. Of course, decentralization is a spectrum, so perhaps there is a middle ground between purely algorithmic tokens and the decentralized model. Regardless, no tokens will succeed until they can prove their viability during times of stress, something that the traditional financial sector also struggles with today.",

        title: "Council Post: Five Myths About The Death Of Retail",
        body: "Expertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author.\n\nCo-Founder and CEO of Zipline, a company that helps brick-and-mortar stores streamline communication and task management.\n\nIt's fashionable these days to pronounce the death of the physical world. The tech press reads like an obituary page -- gold killed by Bitcoin, the office killed by Zoom, reality itself killed by the metaverse. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, many believe the rise of Amazon and a host of wildly popular direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands has spelled the end of retail, too. The narrative is infectious and the prognosis is inevitably bleak. But when it comes to retail, it couldn't be further from the truth.\n\nIt's not hard to see how this idea took hold. Walk around any major downtown area from San Francisco to New York and you'll find plenty of shuttered storefronts with signs in the window thanking loyal customers for years of business. Many people assume this is the fallout from D2C competition or savvy businesses moving online to save themselves. While this is undoubtedly part of the explanation, it's hardly the full picture.\n\nThe fact is that retail is a dynamic sector that is going through major changes that require stores to stay agile to survive. But is retail dead? Hardly. When we examine some of the most pernicious myths about the future of retail, we find that they quickly fall apart under scrutiny.\n\nMyth 1: D2C will cannibalize brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nWho hasn't seen someone at the office wearing a fresh pair of kicks from Allbirds, which managed to make a shoe that was both extremely comfortable and environmentally benign? Ask someone where they got their glasses and there's a good chance they'll tell you Warby Parker, which has made fashionable and affordable eyewear available to everyone. Need a new mattress? Casper will ship it in a box to your doorstep. [Full disclosure: Allbirds and Warby Parker are Zipline customers.]\n\nBesides a knack for elevated consumer products, these online brands have something in common: As they became successful, they all opened physical stores because they understood the value that storefronts bring to a brand. They afford customers the opportunity to admire and try out their products before buying them, becoming a destination online and in real life.\n\nMyth 2: E-commerce meets all of a consumer's needs.\n\nThere's no doubt that ecommerce has removed friction from the shopping experience. With one click, we can go from thinking about an item to summoning it to our doorstep. But ease and efficiency represent only a small part of the shopping experience -- and may not even be the most important one.\n\nModern consumers expect brands to lead a hybrid existence that straddles the digital and physical divide just as they themselves do. The majority of shoppers will conduct an online search before they visit a physical store and, as a result, brands with an omnichannel strategy will see greater customer retention rates compared to businesses that are purely digital or purely analog. This desire for an in-person shopping experience is so strong that many consumers even prefer to return the goods they bought online to a physical store rather than shipping them back to the company.\n\nMyth 3: Retail is a low-skill job.\n\nThere is an unfounded belief that retail sales are a low-skill job. Automation may be more popular now, but there's no replacing human interaction.\n\nThe truth is that retail sales is a complex job that requires not only a healthy dose of intelligence but a strong helping of interpersonal skills, too. Retail salespeople must manage inventory, shop operations, marketing, customer relations and many other duties that will be incredibly challenging to replace with AI or robots for the foreseeable future. Most importantly, they provide a personal experience that customers will always crave, whether it's a product recommendation or simply a smile when they come into the store.\n\nMyth 4: Retailers can achieve faster growth online.\n\nOne of the main pillars of the death of retail myth is the notion that brick-and-mortar stores simply can't compete with digital-first brands. The problem is that this simply doesn't reflect the way these businesses are actually run.\n\nAlthough starting a D2C brand may require less capital upfront compared to a physical store, sustaining an online brand is incredibly challenging. It's expensive to acquire customers and the chances of converting a visitor to a brand's website into a customer hover below 3%.\n\nThe same is not true for physical stores. Not only are customers more likely to buy a product once they're in the store, they also tend to spend more. This leads to steady, predictable growth that can last for years or decades. The growth of D2C brands may look like they're riding a rocketship when they first start, but all too often this growth turns out to be unsustainable and the next big thing becomes just another flash in the pan.\n\nMyth 5: Stores are only for selling products.\n\nWhen you visit a website of your favorite brand, you might find a blog or another form of lighthearted content, but for the most part, the website exists to funnel you into a purchase. Chances are there is a big \"buy now\" button front and center on the home page. These sites are ruthlessly optimized to convert visitors at all costs, and there is a tendency to project these tactics onto brick-and-mortar stores as well. But physical retailers offer so much more.\n\nWalk into a store and you will encounter an ambiance, not a sales funnel. There is music, evolving displays and, most importantly, other people. The community-driven aspect of physical retail locations is their most enduring quality. In addition to selling products, they bring people together through events, whether its yoga sessions at Lululemon or a rock wall at REI. [Full disclosure: Lululemon is a customer of Zipline.] They spark conversations between customers and employees. They offer so much more than the products that line their shelves.\n\nMake no mistake: Physical retail stores are evolving rapidly. But to paraphrase the great Mark Twain, reports of their death have been greatly exaggerated.\n\nForbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.

          "Council Post: Solving The Plastics Problem Demands Systems Thinking",
        body: 'Expertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author.\n\nDr. Steen Tjarks is the President and Co-Founder at T&T Design, a global packaging and artwork agency that specilaizes in private label.\n\nThere are 500 times more microplastics in our oceans than stars in our galaxy. This is partially caused by the breakdown of larger plastic debris, including packaging. Thanks to increasing regulation and shifting public opinion, change is under way, but our efforts need to be unified. To make a real difference, we need to adopt the approach American scientist Peter Senge calls systems thinking, "a discipline for seeing the structures that underlie complex situations, and for discerning high from low leverage change."\n\nThinking Outside The Box\n\nToday, companies talk about the circular economy, a cradle-to-cradle concept that rethinks what enters the market and keeps it in the loop thereafter. Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) funds are on track to reach $53 trillion by 2025 and even U.S. businesses, which have, to date, lagged behind in issues of sustainability, have issued an inspiring new statement on the purpose of American corporations that pledges "shared prosperity and sustainability for both business and society."\n\nBut, apart from a few high-profile initiatives from companies like Starbucks and Coca-Cola, is the corporate world doing enough to tackle the problem of plastic packaging? A 2020 packaging sustainability report from McKinsey claims that historically, companies have pursued a limited packaging sustainability agenda, focused on "quick wins" like reducing weight and material usage improvements. The same report asserts that Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMGC) companies and retailers "will require much closer collaboration with upstream players, packaging converters, and recyclers" to instigate real change. The report calls for deep scientific research into plastic substitutes and the creation of circular value chains, and highlights the need to educate consumers.\n\nUpstream: Recycling Connectivity\n\nThere is evidence that some influential, world-leading brands are moving in the right direction. In pursuit of a vertical integration strategy, Ikea invested in a plastic recycling plant to help attain its goal of producing 100% circular products by 2030.\n\nHowever, vertical integration can go further, such as sourcing recycled raw material from the plastic that is currently destroying our ecosystem. In the Asia-Pacific region alone, there are around 11.1 billion plastic items entangled on coral reefs, a figure that is expected to jump 40% by 2025. The FMCG manufacturers and retailers that are responsible for the bulk of plastic packaging can go further by taking a deeper, more ecological approach that emphasizes restorative action. This extension to environmental stewardship might mean corporate sponsorships of NGOs focused on coral restoration or investments in man-made coral reefs that are powered by wave, wind or solar energy.\n\nMidstream: Design And Materials Innovation\n\nA 2020 report called "Breaking the Plastic Wave" says that current commitments by corporations and governments are inadequate for the scale of the plastic challenge. So what else can be done and how can the design industry help?\n\nBecause of the many colors in which plastics are produced, recycled plastic is usually monochrome, unattractive for branding purposes. Consumers may declare that gray packs are preferable to dirty oceans, yet their subconscious expectations speak as loudly as brand owners\' desire to appeal and differentiate. Evian launched its first bottle made of recycled plastic to much acclaim, featuring an embossed logo instead of a label. However, a preferable solution, according to Prof. Edward Kosior, would be to facilitate mixed recycling by focusing design cues on labels (with self-peeling or dissolvable glue) and stretch-sleeves. Packaging designers must work closely with brand owners, taking full responsibility for every facet of packaging. They must also collaborate with material scientists, finding ways to replace traditional plastics with algae-based bioplastics, paper, bamboo and mushroom styrofoam. Rather than just responding to client briefs, design agencies should make it their business to understand sustainability issues and lead the way.\n\nDownstream: Consumer Engagement\n\nIncreasingly, packaging contains data that enables traceability down the supply chain, supported by blockchain technology. It records the provenance of the product and vouches for its sustainability credentials, from human rights to environmental performance. This data could potentially track the origins of the pack itself, proving where, how and when it was made or recycled and what will happen to it after consumption. Using QR or AR codes on packaging, consumers are now able to use their mobile phones as a personal lens to enter a new dimension, the interactive world of Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality, in which the backstory of the combined product and pack can be shared.\n\nThe pack can also exert influence on the forward story. Food packaging specialist Huhtamaki recently launched an initiative to increase cup recycling, including using QR codes to redirect users to a landing page containing details of the growing numbers of cup recycling sites and schemes. QR codes might be a powerful tool to educate consumers about packaging in general as well as how to dispose of the packaging they\'re currently using.\n\nA 360-Degree Mindset\n\nAlbert Einstein famously stated that we cannot solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used to create them. The World Wildlife Foundation recently brought together multiple companies to address the plastic issue through a new activation hub. Representatives of these companies are clearly aware of the scope of the problem, citing the need for collective action and "unprecedented levels of ambition and collaboration."\n\nContrary to some skeptics who believe that big business will hijack the sustainability agenda for its own ends, I find it more likely that we will witness a new form of what John Fullerton in 2015 called "regenerative capitalism," that will "turn today\'s lopsided (and unsustainable) form of capitalism into an integrated network of balanced, vibrant, and regenerative economies, all serving systemic health within their own unique contexts." Achieving that vision demands interconnectivity, collective thinking throughout the entire supply chain. Manufacturers, retailers, recyclers, material scientists, environmentalists, packaging designers and the consumer all have a part to play. If the stars align, there\'s every chance that they will once again outnumber the microplastics in our oceans.\n\nForbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.

          "New Innovations -- Including A Crypto Card -- Energizing The 'Dying' Credit Card Market",
        body: "Every so often, one financial services observer or another proclaims the death of card cards. Back in April 2013, Motley Fool, in an article titled The Slow Death of Credit Cards declared:\n\n\"Great news: Americans are giving up on one of the most ruthless destroyers of wealth the numerically challenged have ever known: credit cards. We're more interested in debit cards these days. Old style American consumerism, one built on debt, may be coming to an end. Good riddance, credit cards.\"\n\nIn December 2017, CNBC trumpeted \"the age of credit cards may be coming to an end -- and that's a good thing\" and added:\n\n\"You have to admit there are some problems inherent to credit cards. The most glaring of these is that credit cards often aren't 100 percent secure. Users face issues ranging from hackers and fraud to lost and stolen cards.\"\n\nLike that wasn't a problem with cash. And who would ever dream of writing a fraudulent check?\n\nMeanwhile, in the six years following the publication of the Motley Fool article, credit card debt grew by 50% to $930 billion at the end of 2019.\n\nSo much for the \"end of American consumerism.\"\n\nFast forward to 2022, and large credit card issuers like Chase, Citi, and Wells Fargo are seeing strong credit card volume growth. In the first quarter of 2022, the three issuers' volume grew 29%, 24%, and 33% year-over-year, respectively.\n\nJPMorgan's CFO credited the growth, in part, to a \"re-acceleration\" of travel and entertainment spending. According to eMarketer:\n\n\"The bevy of new and revamped card products to recently hit the market should help issuers sustain volume heading into the spring and summer months, especially cards that include T&E-centric rewards: Chase, for example, recently launched the IHG Rewards Premier Business co-brand card and updated IHG Rewards Traveler and Premier consumer co-brand cards.\"\n\nMany people mistakenly believe that older consumers are driving card card volume growth. Not so.\n\nAccording to a recent consumer study from Cornerstone Advisors, 65% of Gen Zers (21 to 26 years old) and 67% of Millennials (27 to 41) have at least one credit card. Not surprising or out of line with other studies.\n\nBut the Cornerstone study found that among Gen Zers, Millennials, and Gen Xers with at least one credit cards, members of those generations spend, on average, 47% of their monthly expenditures (excluding bills) on a credit card.\n\nWhile major issuers try to top each other by outdoing each other on reward levels, a few new entries in the credit card market are worth noting:\n\nCurve aggregates multiple payment cards, allowing its users to make payments and withdrawals from a single card. Users link their debit and credit cards to the Curve card and either set a default card from which to make payments can then be set, or establish rules to assign certain types of payments to particular cards.\n\nCurve also lets users switch the card they paid with after a transaction is complete, as long as it's within the payment cycle.\n\nAccording to Cornerstone Advisors' research, among consumers with a credit card, half of Gen Zers, 57% of Millennials, and nearly two-thirds of Gen Xers have two or more credit cards.\n\nAdd to that the fact that 35% of Gen Zers, four in 10 Millennials, and a third of Gen Xers have two or more checking accounts -- each with its own debit card -- and the number of payment cards today's consumers have really starts to add up.\n\nOriginally available in the UK, Curve announced its US launch in March 2022.\n\nThe concept of merchant branded (aka private label) credit cards has been around for a long time, but the economics of the arrangement makes it nearly impossible for merchants below a certain size to participate, thanks to onerously high initial implementation costs.\n\nEnter Tandym.\n\nTandym makes it easy for merchants with less than $1 billion in revenue to offer their own branded- or private-label cards. Via an API-based direct connection that cuts out the intermediaries, Tandym's core product converts a merchant's transaction costs into future revenues by diverting processing fees into a customer loyalty program.\n\nWith Tandym, merchants of any size can offer a payment product with their own branding and logo throughout their eCommerce experience and enable customers to earn points towards future purchases at the merchant.\n\nFounded by former Capital One execs with deep experience in the co-branded credit card space, Tandym will help expand store-branded credit to a wider range of consumers -- and merchants -- than has been feasible so far.\n\nCrypto debit cards have been in the market for a few years, but now crypto credit cards are beginning to emerge.\n\nAccording to FXC Intelligence:\n\n\"Crypto cards primarily come in two types: cards that convert cryptocurrency into fiat so that it can be used to make a payment, often with additional crypto rewards, and fiat-based cards that provide crypto as a cashback reward.\"\n\nBlockFI was the first in the US market with a crypto credit card in July 2021, offering 15% cash back after a 3.5% rewards for the first three months. Gemini and Nexo launched their offerings in April 2022.\n\nMany of the cards (both credit and debit) require cardholders to maintain a crypto balance with the issuer. With the Nexo Card, for example, cardholders use their crypto assets to open a line of credit and make purchases in fiat currencies while using their crypto holdings as collateral, according to FXC Intelligence.\n\nNeither the Gemini or BlockFI cards charge transaction fees, but with the Nexo card, FX fees kick in after a certain amount of transactions.\n\nThere's a segment of the population who wish credit cards would go away, and they jump on any negative change in the credit card market as evidence of the decline and impending death of credit cards.\n\nIt's just not realistic thinking.\n\nThe use of physical cards may decline, but there is simply too much supply and demand for credit in the market. In fact, the Nilson Report projects that credit card purchase volume in the US will grow 39% between 2021 and 2026, with outstandings increasing by 35% over the same period.\n\nAnd as the latest Fed data shows, buy now, pay later (BNPL) debt is additive to credit card debt, not a substitute. So how are the BNPL providers going to grow? By offering broader line of credit offerings (i.e., credit cards) as young and thin file consumers' responsible use of credit increases.\n\nAdd in innovative new offerings from Curve, Tandym, and companies offering crypto credit cards, and the future of credit cards has never looked better.",

        body: "The investors/traders must keep a close eye on Bitcoin movement as MATIC shares a staggering 90% 30-day correlation with the King coin.\n\nPolygon (MATIC) was on long-term uptrends as it formed a six-month rising wedge, hitting its all-time high (ATH) in December. Since then, MATIC has been on a downhill while having a topsy-turvy relationship with the EMA ribbons.\n\n(Source: TradingView)\n\nAs the current falling wedge decline approaches the long-term floor at $0.93, the bulls would be keen to break the streak of the bearish candlestick on the daily chart. At the time of writing, MATIC trades at $0.941, with a 24-hour trading volume of $548 million, and down by 5.79%.\n\nMoreover, MATIC's price is open to hitting another 21% to retest the range low at $0.745. In some circumstances, if the selling tension spikes quite a bit, there is a good possibility that Polygon could stoop lower.\n\nThis recession could allow market makers to fill the price inefficiency known as the fair value gap at $0.467, bringing the total downfall to 52%.\n\nSurprisingly enough, IntoTheBlock's Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM) model backs this bearish viewpoint. This index reveals that around 30,000 addresses bought nearly 1.8 billion MATIC tokens at an average price of $0.473 and are \"Out of the Money.\"\n\n(Source: Global In/Out Money)\n\nTherefore, a drop into this barrier is possible to be supported by these investors who could choose to buy more, alleviating the selling pressure.\n\nTo sum up, in light of the falling wedge set-up coupled with the potential of bullish divergence on the RSI, MATIC could see a short-term revival. A close above the current pattern would expose the altcoin to the boundaries of its EMA ribbons in the $1.2 - $1.3 range.\n\nFinally, the investors/traders must keep a close eye on Bitcoin movement as MATIC shares a staggering 90% 30-day correlation with the King coin.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this article are solely the author's and do not necessarily reflect the views of CoinQuora.

        body: "I write about crypto & fintech projects and their impact in the world.\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day marks the day that Laszlo Hanyecz made the first recorded purchase of a physical good using Bitcoin. He spent 10,000 Bitcoin to purchase two Papa John's pizzas on May 22, 2010. Since Papa John's didn't accept Bitcoin as payment, he posted a 10,000 Bitcoin offer on Bitcointalk.org and Jeremy Sturdivant, a 19-year old then, took the offer for an estimated $41, bought the two pizzas and delivered.\n\nToday, the Bitcoin community worldwide commemorates May 22 as the first recorded day that Bitcoin was used to purchase a physical good. The community celebrates by buying two pizzas and sharing them. Pizza restaurants also contribute to the celebration by offering discounts to customers who pay in Bitcoin.\n\nLaszlo responded to the delivery on BitcoinTalk.org by saying, \"That pizza looks delicious! Adorable kid. (Cheesy Emoji)\". He later stated that he was willing to pay 10,000 Bitcoins for future pizza deliveries. On the same thread, he stated, \"My 1 year old daughter really enjoys pizza too! She just smears it all over her face if you give her a whole slice, but she does eventually manage to get most of it in her mouth (minus a few loose toppings of course).\" It's a beautiful story. Laszlo took a family photo after the delivery marking perhaps one of the biggest milestones in the Bitcoin story.\n\nThe initial response for anyone new to this story is to check the dollar value of the Bitcoin spent on the two pizzas today. As of this writing, one Bitcoin is trading at $33,064.19. This means that the 10,000 Bitcoin would be worth $330.6419 million today. Looking in hindsight, it may seem like a bad financial decision, but haven't we all made similar decisions in life? Nobody knows the future.\n\nThe reason why the global Bitcoin community celebrates this event is mainly about Bitcoin as a technological revolution and invention of sound money. The year 2010 was about 24 months after the global financial crisis. People had begun to question the current economic models, economic policies, and money as a store of value. Bitcoin offered a new hope to the people.\n\nThe May 22 pizza transaction paved the way for a decentralized form of money with a hard capitalization of 21 million that can be sent and received without permission. The world had not yet seen a tamper-proof, sensor-proof digital currency with no centralized issuer.\n\nSince May 22, 2010, the Bitcoin community has grown and developments have been made that allow you to buy a pizza using Bitcoin on the lightning network today, with transaction costs reduced to cents on the dollar. Thousands of merchants now accept Bitcoin payments for pizza and other products, and infrastructure has advanced to the point where you no longer need to post a bitcoin offer on BitcoinTalk.org to purchase a product.\n\nYvonne Kagondu, the founder of Kenya Blockchain Ladies DAO in my home country of Kenya, is organizing a Bitcoin Pizza Day party in Nairobi. What are your plans for May 22nd?",

        title:
          "China to Accept Digital Yuan on Public Transport in 12 Cities By DailyCoin",
        body: "The tech-savvy people of China will now be able to enjoy a more convenient life in Guangzhou, where public transport tickets can be purchased via China's digital yuan app. China became the first country to issue a digital version of their national currency, and the digital yuan (also known as e-CNY, and digital RMB) is set to be made available in 23 cities. As it is a form of central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital yuan is owned by the national bank. Some Chinese commercial banks will be able to operate using the currency, however, they must be provided with a licence from the Central bank.\n\nThe All-in-One App for Chinese Citizens\n\nAll it takes is a QR code to buy a tram fare in Guangzhou. Government officials in China had previously announced the release of a digital yuan app for iOS and Android in 23 cities, but only in 12 of those cities is the digital yuan already fully operational. Though, of course, that list will expand in due time. The People's Bank of China released an agreement on April 2nd, 2022, which outlined that the program will include 6 cities in the Zhejiang region, which will hold the 2022 Asian Games.\n\nXiamen, still fresh on the digital currency list, alreadys offer tits residents the option to top up their public transportation swipe cards through the app. The next step will be to add full functionality such as that in bigger cities like Guangzhou, thereby enabling passengers to pay for each fare directly through the app.\n\nThis digital currency (e-CNY) is backed by the Chinese yuan, bills and coins, as well as being supported by the Central bank's silver and gold reserves. Considering that RMB is a fixed-price currency, China's national digital coin provides a sense of stability. However, for foreigners, there might be difficulties in acquiring and using the currency, one being the language barrier, as the digital yuan app is only available in Chinese.\n\nThe digital yuan is a good example of a government-owned digital currency. It's a simpler version of digital currency, compared to crypto, due to a couple of factors. First of all, e-CNY is not decentralized as crypto is, and second of all, it's not based on blockchain tech. Therefore, the digital yuan was designed predominantly for casual transactions and retail purchases.\n\nSince there are over 80 countries in the world already working on their own national digital currency, the Chinese digital yuan screams success, especially when one can easily prove the need for it through numbers. Digital yuan (e-CNY) transactions reached the $11 billion mark last year, and now, with its increasing availability and adoption, this number can only be expected to increase as 2022 draws on.",

        title: "Be Prepared For Hiring Freezes And Layoffs",
        body: "The United States is starting to experience events that may cause the job market to slow down. After Covid-19 restrictions were lifted and the economy reopened, the job market became hot. Businesses couldn't find enough talent to meet their needs. If you were searching for a new job, you had an abundance of choices. Sadly, the good times don't last forever.\n\nCorporate executives crave certainty. They want to know that the future looks bright. If management feels that the economy and events align so that their business will make money and prosper, they'll aggressively invest in hiring more staff. When there is a high demand for their products and services, smart leaders will add headcount to keep stoking the growth.\n\nConversely, when the C-suite is concerned about the future and worried that things may take a turn for the worse, they'll reign in expenditures. This includes cutting back on hiring and culling the workforce to cut costs. Executives will say that once the situation improves, they'll start hiring again. Until then, management will hunker down, conserve resources and wait out the bad times.\n\nThe stock market, which was setting record highs regularly, got ahead of itself. In the last few weeks, stocks have plummeted. The reasons behind the sudden and swift decline include inflation driving up costs, fear of the U.S. getting involved with the Russia and Ukraine war, domestic political tensions and concerns over a recession on the horizon. Consequently, there have been several companies that have either paused hiring or commenced layoffs.\n\nLayoffs.fyi Tracker, as the name suggests, is a site that compiles a list of downsizings in the tech and startup space. It began during the early days of the pandemic when companies were aggressively firing and furloughing workers. Once the economy reopened, the number of pink slips subsided. Now, there is a concerningly large number of businesses in the tech sector laying off personnel.\n\nMeta is enacting a hiring pause and so are Uber and Amazon. Mortgage startup Better.com, best known for the CEO who fired people via a oneway Zoom video and called employees \"dumb dolphins\" laid off approximately 4,000 people. As the stock market and cryptocurrencies falter, Robinhood cut about 300 people. Netflix, Peloton, Cameo, Wells Fargo, Noom, On Deck, Workrise and others have also announced layoffs or temporary freezes.\n\nIn a faltering job market, you don't want to be the one fired. It will be hard to find a new job when a large number of companies in your industry are also laying off people. You must ensure that you are not replaceable. To do this, you have to prove to your bosses that they need you more than anyone else on the team.\n\nThe first thing is to show up at the office, even if you're a remote worker. There is a known proximity bias. If you show face time, it curries favor with the managers, compared to the folks at home who can become out of sight and out of mind.\n\nVolunteer for assignments. Take on tasks no one else wants. Find out what you can do to help your boss look good. Then, take action. Make sure that important people know that you are working hard and delivering every day. Keep track of your accomplishments and share the data with your supervisor.\n\nHave a good positive attitude. Don't complain, gossip or criticize. It's called playing the game. The object is to win by keeping your job or at least hanging on until you can find something else outside of the company.",

        body: "Don't miss CoinDesk's Consensus 2022, the must-attend crypto & blockchain festival experience of the year in Austin, TX this June 9-12.\n\nThe reality of tighter monetary policy continues to be felt in all markets, including crypto, with bitcoin (BTC) - which days ago topped $40,000 - crumbling to as low as $32,500.\n\nBitcoin lost the critical support level of $40,000 last week, and did not hold above subsequent support levels at $38,000 and $35,800. It could drop to as low as $31,500 if current levels fail to hold.\n\nCrypto majors followed bitcoin's drop: Ether (ETH) lost 8.7% in the past 24 hours, while Cardano's ADA (ADA) and Solana's SOL (SOL) dipped as much as 10%. Memecoin shiba inu (SHIB) took an even bigger hit with a 13% fall.\n\nLiquidations on crypto-tracked futures exceed $411 million in the past 24 hours, data show. Of that, some $140 million arose from bitcoin futures and $121 million came from ether futures.\n\nBitcoin's initial weekend declines came alongside TerraUSD (UST) losing its peg to the dollar. The fall added steam on Sunday evening as Asian equity markets and U.S. stock index futures opened sharply lower, with fears continuing to grow about the monetary response to surging inflation. Japan's Nikkei ended the day 2.5% lower, Europe's Stoxx 600 is down 2% at midday, and Nasdaq futures are down 1.5%.\n\nThe U.S. dollar, meanwhile, continues to benefit from panicky markets, with the Australian dollar and Indian rupee notable losers today.\n\nAnalysts previously warned about a drop in bitcoin prices if the broader economic outlook continued to sour. \"Professional money managers aren't loading up on high-risk growth assets currently,\" said Kurt Grumelart, a trader at crypto fund Zerocap, in a Telegram message last week. \"You can't look past current headwinds and high correlation to traditional markets,\" he added at the time, warning about bitcoin's current price correlation with U.S. markets.",

In the face of this bea market, Algorand (ALGO) has stood out from the pack, raking in gains while other cryptos collapse.\n\nAlgorand (ALGO) Soars in a Bearish Market\n\nReacting to interest rates being increased by the Fed, the crypto market, led by Bitcoin, fell to its lowest point since January. However, Algorand (ALGO) quickly recovered from its 11% fall on Thursday to continue to rally.\n\nAs part of its recovery, Algorand (ALGO) rose from its Thursday low by 9.93%, reaching $0.7488 before continuing its rally on Saturday, when it gained a further 7.39% in value to set a four-week high at $0.7812.\n\nThe seven day price chart for Algorand (ALGO).

According to data from DeFiLlama, Algorand's total value locked (TVL) has risen by 15% in the last week, and by over 31% in the last 30 days, reaching $205.49 million.\n\nThe Total Value Locked (TVL) in Algorand.

          "Global Titans Introduce First Sporting Event With NFT Enabled Livestream Access",
        body: 'I cover film, TV and entertainment through the lens of a producer.\n\nNew company Global Titans are set to introduce NFT enabled access to live sports shows. The company will introduce premium boxing and MMA events at locations around the world with the debut event featuring fighters such as Floyd Mayweather and Anderson Silva.\n\nGlobal Titans fight events will be held every three months for at least the next two years. The debut show will signify the first time an NFT ticket will be used to enable fans to watch a live stream online.\n\nThe NFT tickets can also be used for other elements that standard tickets cannot, with extra benefits and event assets that the holder will own, including a competition to win a trip to the debut event in Dubai, live stream online event access, a collectible 3D crystal ticket, world game coins that can be used in 300 online games, a choice of 8 fighter NFT ticket options, unlock-able official fight videos, exclusive content from backstage and free access to the next Global Titans event.\n\nThe firm will also be launching the Global Titans universe in July 2022, which will include the GTF$ cryptocurrency, online multiplayer games, metaverse content and real-world experiences. The goal is to create an ecosystem for the new generation of fight fans.\n\n"We aim to create a bridge between existing and new fight fans, whilst simultaneously introducing new technologies into an industry which has barely changed in decades." Said Global Titans CEO, Uday Singh.\n\nHe continued: "Like any new venture with innovative technologies and solutions, new adoption in the mainstream is always a challenge. Being the first organization in the world to provide an NFT enabled live stream sports event is no easy task. There are multiple challenges in technology, operations, marketing, broadcasting and more."\n\n"The understanding and awareness of NFTs are still growing and in its early stages, meaning it is vitally important to engage with the early adopters and embrace them into this exciting Web3 project."\n\nWith some fight fans potentially not understanding the NFT marketplace, Singh specified that an easy process for people that are not web3 savvy would be paramount, but if that hurdle is overcome people will realize just how much of a step up their methodology could be juxtaposed to the standardized ticket model.\n\nSingh concluded, "The primary focus is to give great value to fans. This project now raises people\'s expectations of what they will receive when purchasing a \'ticket\'. Instead of just an email with a barcode, fans will now receive so much more through Global Titans events. The event industry is about to undergo a major shift in technology and value-added services, and we are at the forefront of that."\n\n"Furthermore, Global Titans is about achieving a win-win for all parties involved. For example, fighters competing at the events have a great degree of freedom across the entire project. Unlike other boxing and MMA organizations, Global Titans do not lock fighters into difficult contracts or restrictive sponsorship agreements. This creates great buy-in and fighters have much greater earning potential across all revenue streams."\n\n"The fighters and the fans are at the center of everything."\n\nThe current focus around Web3 affecting entertainment is on developing the customer experience so someone\'s daily life can be more streamlined and easier to navigate through its adoption. Singh is hoping that Global Titans\' fight series will be a historic first step in that journey.\n\nThe debut event is being held on May 14th 2022 live and directly on the helipad of the Burj Al Arab Jumeirah hotel in Dubai.',

        title:
          "African Crypto Startup Raises $30 Million To Build A Web3 WeChat",
        body: "I cover cryptocurrencies and other applications of blockchain\n\nn the past year, play-to-earn games like Axie Infinity have transformed the livelihoods of thousands of people, particularly in developing nations of Southeast Asia, where high unemployment combined with widespread smartphone penetration have led those struggling during the pandemic to look for an alternative source of income. With Axie, all it took was a smartphone, an internet connection, and a few extra hours.\n\nThat success story is not lost on James, 26, and Alice Zhang, 30, founders of up-and-coming cryptocurrency startup Jambo (the word means \"hello\" in Swahili). Natives of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the siblings started the company six months ago with the aim of bringing Web3, a blockchain-based version of the internet, to Africa. But their ambitions are much bigger than just gaming - they want to create a hub for Africa's entire digital economy.\n\n\"We hope to become the super app of Africa, similarly to what WeChat has done in China in the last decade,\" says James.\n\nTo that end, the company has revealed exclusively to Forbes the completion of a $30 million Series A funding round led by crypto-focused venture firm Paradigm. It is Paradigm's first investment in the continent. Other high-profile investors in the round include Pantera Capital, Delphi Ventures, Kingsway Capital and Gemini Frontier Fund. The announcement comes quickly on the heels of Jambo's $7.5 million seed round raised from Coinbase Ventures, Alameda Research and Tiger Global, among others.\n\n\"Axie has been a really good example of how you can onboard a region through play-to-earn,\" says Paradigm's investment partner Casey Caruso, who has also helped the firm's investment into Axie Infinity's creator Sky Mavis. \"We think of play-to-earn as just the beginning for Africa and specifically the beginning for Jambo.\"\n\nWith its young population (70% of sub-Saharan Africa is under the age of 30), ever-growing smartphone penetration and third-fastest growing cryptocurrency economy, according to blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis, the market opportunity is massive.\n\neing a super app means becoming a one-stop-shop for everything crypto. So while Jambo is testing about a dozen play-to-earn games including Axie Infinity that could meet local data bandwidth among other considerations, the startup is also working on a non-custodial wallet, which will allow users to send and swap cryptocurrencies as well as yearn yield on their holdings. Planned for launch in the third quarter of this year, it has locked in over 30,000 signups.\n\nZhang says many technicalities, such as the details of Jambo's own token which will likely hit the market along with the main product, still need to be resolved, but points out that the wallet is being developed on Polygon, a prominent scaling layer for Ethereum. Polygon's cofounder and CEO Sandeep Nailwal and the project's gaming and NFT arm, Polygon Studios, contributed to Jambo's seed financing round.\n\nAside from developing the product suite, these funds are helping the company expand its geographic footprint on the continent. In the past months, the founders have gathered a 100-member team and opened offices in 15 countries including Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa, where Jambo is partnering with thousands of internet cafes and college booths to improve student access to computers and high-speed internet and its ambassadors are offering 10-week courses on Web 3. By the end of this year, the firm hopes to establish a presence in 15 additional cities with the goal of having over 200,000 active community members.\n\nAdditionally, in the spirit of WeChat's parent company, Tencent, which has reportedly invested in more than 800 companies, Jambo is launching the AfricaDAO investment fund to index crypto development on the continent. \"We want to empower and invest in startups who share in our vision and mission to positively impact the lives of millions across Africa for decades to come,\" Zhang says.",

          "Council Post: 16 Tech Leaders Share Their Favorite Time-Savers And Productivity Hacks",
        body: "Expertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author.\n\nTech leaders are certainly no strangers to lengthy to-do lists. Luckily, with their expertise, they have the inside track when it comes to the old mantra, \"Work smarter, not harder.\" Tech leaders have tested many tools and strategies, and they know what has proven to be effective time after time.\n\nWhether they're navigating through a jam-packed workday or keeping their family activities on track, the members of Forbes Technology Council regularly return to their favorite time- and labor-saving methods. Here, 16 of them share a variety of tech tools and hacks that can help anyone boost their productivity and take a load off their to-do list (and mind).\n\n1. Get Full Use Of Your Tech By Reading The User Manual\n\nTo boost your productivity, know your tools. Consumers seldom read the user manuals and rarely use more than a fraction of the features provided by the tools they use every day. Learning all of the capabilities of the tools you have in front of you is a \"quick win\" that will boost your productivity. - Rene Head, The Methodical Group\n\n2. Make Written Communication Easier With Dictation Apps\n\nText-to-speech and dictation features and apps are an incredibly simple way to help with productivity, especially for neurodivergent individuals who may face different challenges with writing, reading and attention. These tools allow us to communicate with colleagues and organize our thoughts in the way that's most efficient and effective for how we think and work. - Jenny Wu, Understood\n\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives. Do I qualify?\n\n3. Collaborate On Discord\n\nDiscord has done a fantastic job of creating collaboration tools, and while it hasn't penetrated the business market yet, I believe it will become Slack's biggest competitor. It came out of the gaming community, and the setup is amazing, especially with everyone working from home. You can talk to a large group of people and easily create channels and servers, and everyone is in the same voice channel. - Kevin Marcus, Versium\n\n4. Tap Into The Full Capabilities Of Management Tools\n\nManagement tools such as Asana and Trello increase productivity and efficiency by helping you track the progress of your individual and shared projects. Creating separate boards for tasks that are in progress, completed or on hold provides a high-level overview of your priorities over a certain period and allows you to make viable plans for the future. - Yasin Altaf, GoodCore Software\n\n5. Use The Tools That Help You At Work For Family Needs\n\nMy husband is a first responder, and we have households in two different states. In addition to having virtual meetings for homework assistance using software such as Microsoft Teams and keeping shared Google calendars, we use Volley for everyday video communication, and Slack is our digital family bulletin board. - Tara Anderson, Framework Security\n\n6. Use Multiplatform Apps For Working And Texting\n\nApps that work on both mobile devices and desktops allow you to easily switch modes, whether you are at your desk or on the go, and texting is always more efficient than voice calls and emails. The combination of these two will make you much more efficient, help you avoid missing calls and minimize the need for lengthy meetings and calls. - Henri Isenberg, ReviewInc\n\n7. Keep Notes In Digital Format For Easy Access\n\nI use OneNote, but any digital note keeper that allows you to search will do. Having notes in a form that allows me to search for text, names, projects and so on has been a critical time-saver. There have been tons of times I've thought to myself, \"I know I have a note about that somewhere ...\" but I've had no idea where. Search to the rescue! - Stephanie Domas, Intel\n\n8. Use Tools To Track Your Time\n\nThe one thing that people take for granted more than anything else in life is time. Using tools that track how you spend your time can give you greater insight into how productive you are already. Simply training yourself to put your phone down so you have time to focus will help you gain insight into how you spend your time. A great tool for that is Forest. - Indiana (Indy) Gregg, Wedo\n\n9. Learn And Leverage Keyboard Shortcuts\n\nWhat helps each person be more productive is very personal, as everyone adapts differently to each hack or tool. I'd like to share three tips. First, Clipboard Manager is a great tool; it enables infinite copy and paste, which helps in many situations. Second, learn the keyboard shortcuts for the applications you use -- you'll gain speed on routine tasks. Finally, set daily goals. It's very important to focus and avoid procrastination, and it gives you the feeling of \"mission accomplished\" every day. - Mateus Hernandes Rodrigues, DB1 Global Software\n\n10. Use Your Calendar To Track Your To-Do's\n\nI tend to use my Outlook calendar as a to-do list for important tasks. When I have an assignment that has a specific timeline for completion, I will block time on my calendar for that task a day or two before it is due. That not only reminds me about the task but also ensures that I will have uninterrupted time on my calendar to get it done. - Ken Knapton, Progrexion\n\n11. Try Tools For Mental Mapping\n\nI am very intentional and curious; this allows me to always carry a mental map of what I need to achieve and what it's important to accomplish to reach a goal. This also allows me to be nimble in slotting new information in easily so I can adjust and evolve my goals. Lately, I have found Whimsical to be exceptional at helping me externalize what's in my head. - Sairam Rangachari, Tandym Inc.\n\n12. Dig Into Excel (Or Google Sheets)\n\nMastering Excel is an amazing way to speed up your work. When I say \"mastering,\" I don't mean opening the platform and writing a few quick functions; I mean learning it -- deeply. And if you were born with the cloud, every Gmail user has access to what I consider an even more powerful, free alternative: Google Sheets! You can even write JavaScript code. If you haven't done it yet, do it now. - Sacha Labourey, CloudBees\n\n13. Set Up Filtering And Sorting Tools For Your Email\n\nFilter and sort your incoming email by response priority. This can be done simply by using rules in Outlook or filters in Gmail, or you can even use a more comprehensive approach with an inbox replacement tool such as Superhuman. The point is to avoid having your attention divided between things that can wait and those that should be dealt with swiftly. This simple act dramatically improves productivity. - Leon Carelli, Locks Law Firm\n\n14. Simplify Your Meeting Scheduling Process\n\nMy biggest \"win\" in the last ten years has been adopting Calendly to automate booking meetings on my calendar. It provides a self-service method for my team members and networking contacts to book meetings with me, and it also makes it super simple for me to book a meeting myself. I never have a conflict, reminders are sent automatically and I built in a five-minute break between meetings. - Dave Todaro, Ascendle\n\n15. Journal And Track Your Daily Goals\n\nTake 30 minutes each day to journal and envision your goals for the day, with some soothing music. It calms your mind, and it helps you document your activities for the day. You can use any productivity tool that works for you -- but make sure you will actually use it. I choose to use either a physical or online Kanban board to capture my backlog or what I need to get done, what is in progress and what is done. Give it a week. - Windy Nicholson, Salesforce\n\n16. Put Down The Tech Tools For A While\n\nIt may seem counterintuitive for a tech tool hack, but the greatest boost in productivity comes from focus -- and focus is a state of mind, not an app or appliance. Put away the tech for at least 15 minutes a day. Go to a quiet, comfortable place; think about what is urgent and what is important, and do not let the tyranny of the urgent distract you from the few important things before you. Then act. - Andrew Chrostowski, RealWear, Inc.",

        body: "More worries about China's growth, along with jitters around President Vladimir Putin's next move in Ukraine, are helping take a bite out of Wall Street at the start of the week. That's in addition to other worries.\n\n\"The global investment community is slowly waking up to the idea we have touted for a long time: That there is a post-COVID-recovery-euphoria 'hangover,' coupled with associated inflation and now a European war and fresh inflation impetus as well as the world's biggest port being closed,\" , chief economist at ACY Securities.\n\nIt's worth listening these days to seasoned money managers who have been through economic downturns involving scorching inflation, as well as geopolitical tensions.\n\nMichael Cuggino, president and portfolio manager of the nearly 40-year old multiasset Permanent Portfolio Family of Funds PRPFX, -0.38%, is back with some fresh advice and our call of the day.\n\nCuggino spoke to MarketWatch late last year, where he warned that a new generation of investors was involving high inflation and rising interest rates, both of which have been unfolding further in recent months.\n\nIn a recent interview, he explained that they are managing all the fresh uncertainty by doing what they always do -- \"driving down the middle of the road.\" That's particularly important now because so many questions remain unanswered with regard to growth, inflation and geopolitics, he said.\n\nThe fund is divvied up into roughly 42% stocks, 36% bonds and straight commodity exposure. Year to date, it's down about 4%, versus a 13% slump for the S&P 500 SPX, -1.64%, though it has .\n\nCuggino said lower-volatility equities, exposure to raw materials and high-quality bonds have given his fund some cushion over these bumpy few months. \"We recommend staying very diversfied...but even with diversification, if the whole world is volatile, you're going to be impacted by that at some level,\" he said.\n\nCuggino worries about where inflation will end up and how long it will stick around, and really at what point consumers just start cutting way back. Should inflation prove extremely stubborn, investors will want to stick to industries that can control cost structure and pricing power, he said, adding that \"that theme runs through our equities, regardless of the industry.\"\n\nHow far the Fed will raise interest rates, the midterm elections, and concerns over the Chinese economy are also simmering topics. Some investors argue the coming Chinese slowdown means the commodity rally has gone too far, while others say it just means stimulus is ahead when COVID-19 shutdowns end, Cuggino noted, adding: \"I think both are plausible, so broadly speaking, we have exposure in both those areas.\"\n\nAs for the range of stocks the fund is invested in, U.S. miner Freeport-McMoRan FCX, -2.90% is his top holding, while the fund has a toe in tech with Nvidia NVDA, -4.21% and Meta Platforms FB, -2.13%, with Lockheed Martin LMT, -0.42% and Costco COST, -0.48% among other big holdings.\n\nRead:\n\nThe buzz\n\nAs Russia's Victory Day parade gets under way, Putin said the West forced his country into the monthslong and bloody invasion.

The company says it will use the funds to scale up its business and expand to new countries.\n\n\"We are extremely excited and proud to bring on board this high-quality investment, allowing us to accelerate the development of our core payment solutions, while also expanding into new territories within our core markets of Southeast Asia and Japan and beyond,\" Jun Hasegawa, founder and CEO of Opn said in a statement.\n\nThe latest funding came from investors such as JIC Venture Growth Investments, MUFG Bank, and Mars Growth Capital. Opn has raised more than $222 million in total funding to date. The latest investment also coincides with the firm rebranding itself as Opn. Previously, it was known as Synqa.\n\nOpn was cofounded by Hasegawa and Ezra Don Harinsut in 2013, and first launched in Thailand in 2015. The company now has operations in Japan, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Vietnam. It currently has 500 employees that serve more than 7,000 merchants.\n\nThe company specializes in online payments, blockchain technology for fintech applications and digital transformation solutions.

        title: "Deadmau5 And Richie Hawtin Talk New Gaming Venture PIXELYNX",
        body: 'Technology within the dance music industry is moving at a rapid pace, and the trend continues with deadmau5\'s and Richie Hawtin\'s new gaming venture, PIXELYNX.\n\nPIXELYNX is a music gaming platform created by musicians and technologists deadmau5, Hawtin and music and gaming industry veterans Ben Turner, Dean Wilson and Inder Phull. The company, based in London and Los Angeles, is focused on building a music metaverse that transforms the way artists connect and engage with their fans through gaming experiences. Indeed, PIXELYNX is shaping the future of music by giving artists the means to put power back in their own hands. The gaming platform can be found on Discord.\n\nAccording to deadmau5, the platform is "healthy" for community building. He adds that this platform was sparked by metaverses creating forms of event production during the pandemic. "Web3, to me, just for music and creation, screams liberation from the social norms that we know," deadmau5 says in the video of how music gets on a [digital signal processor]."\n\nIn addition, Hawtin says that he used early versions of touch designer, which gives artists real time visualization, audio visual connections and pipeline, in 2004. "This is just another extension of using technology to reach out and connect to likeminded people and share in experiences," he says in the video. "I think music, in its present form, is pretty archaic. It\'s solid. That\'s what it is. You can\'t break it apart. You can\'t really interact with it," Hawtin notes.\n\nThe two sat down at International Music Summit Ibiza for a virtual conversation discussing the music metaverse and PIXELYNX. During the talk, Hawtin and deadmau5 break down the new Web3 frontier for artists and fans, showcasing how creators can continue growing their communities in new and meaningful ways. "Web3 is the flagbearer of transparency for an artist," deadmau5 says.',

        body: "Cryptocurrencies are melting down fast enough to create the century's Nightmare in 2022. I had warned that the double top formation by Bitcoin in November 2021 had already been indicted on Nov 10, 2022. I pointed out this steep slide in Bitcoin prices in an article I wrote.\n\nTechnically speaking, in a monthly chart, the Bitcoin started a steep upward move in March 2020 after testing a low at $3937, and in April 2021 hit its first lifetime high at $64,400.\n\nSoon after testing this first lifetime in April 2021, Bitcoin witnessed a steep fall and tested a low in July 2021 at $29,350 before resuming an uptrend and hitting the second lifetime high in November 2021 at $8,930.\n\nComputer hacking had already developed manifolds during this decade. Hackers were encouraged to be part of different types of wars among the countries to prove themselves as the most powerful nations since a sudden surge in trade war tussle between the U.S. and China in October 2018.\n\nAfter the invasion of Ukraine by Russia on Feb 24, this warfare looks to be changing dimensions for the cryptocurrencies as the sanctions imposed on Russia by the US and the other western countries could encourage Russian hackers to disrupt the monetary systems of the sanction-imposers.\n\nThe sharp slide in cryptocurrencies could continue for a long time as most countries' governments look to be under the fear of losing their control over the regulation of crypto-generated shaky moves in the equity and the forex markets now.\n\nI explained the retracement zone in case of such a fall at that time. Let's wait and watch how the governments take action on this front to tighten their control over their monetary control. These tightening efforts will define the further direction of cryptocurrencies.\n\nDisclaimer: This content is for information and educational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice or an investment recommendation.

        title: "Putin's Crackdown Pushes Independent Russian Media Into Crypto",
        body: "Meduza, a prominent independent Russian-language news site, knew it was in trouble after Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine. But it didn't expect the issues to come from Western sanctions.\n\nSoon after the measures were announced, Russian readers began complaining payments via Stripe to the Latvian-based outlet weren't going through, after the payments firm was forced to stop its service in the country.\n\n\"We couldn't predict that the sanctions of Western governments will come first and destroy our crowdfunding,\" forcing Meduza to start soliciting crypto and rely entirely on money from foreigners for the first time, Editor-in-Chief Ivan Kolpakov said.\n\nAfter Putin essentially outlawed independent reporting on the war, keeping the lights on has become as important to Russia's free press as figuring out how to report about their country from abroad after the new restrictions scattered hundreds of local journalists around the world.\n\nThe unprecedented pressure forced numerous independent media outlets to shut down, and other resources have been blocked by the government censor. Novaya Gazeta, whose editor Dmitry Muratov won the Nobel Peace Prize last year, suspended publication in March after regulators issued it warnings about its coverage, while Ekho Moskvy radio station had its FM frequency handed over to a state-run propaganda outlet.\n\nRussia Paper Whose Editor Won Nobel Shuts Down Under Pressure\n\nThe Kremlin is also targeting social media, blocking Meta Platforms Inc's Facebook and Instagram for \"extremist\" activities. Roskomnadzor, the internet censor, has issued fines and warnings to Alphabet Inc.'s Google over its YouTube policies. TikTok suspended live-streaming in Russia over the restrictions.\n\nAmid the media crackdown, Putin's popularity has soared, though it's not clear how accurate public opinion polling is in Russia. In a March survey by the independent Levada Center, 83% approved of Putin's actions as president, an increase of 12 percentage points on the previous month and the highest since 2017.\n\nBlocked Content\n\nMeduza continues to publish investigations, including a recent chronicle of alleged atrocities committed during the Russian occupation of a town near Kyiv. The Kremlin denies its troops have committed war crimes.\n\nThe content is blocked in Russia, forcing users in Meduza's main market to use virtual private networks to access it.\n\nTheir audience adapted quickly, as Meduza has pushed readers to download their news app and follow their Telegram channel. Kolpakov said they felt like a group of survivors in a bunker warning that the \"apocalypse will come.\"\n\nMeduza lost about a third of its traffic after the restrictions. And they still have bills to pay. Now, instead of relying on donations from some 30,000 Russian readers who supported it before the war, Meduza is asking its international audience to send dollars, euros or crypto as soon as possible to help its 25 journalists resettle mostly in Riga.\n\nTheir donations page includes instructions on how to buy Bitcoin and Ethereum on Binance or, for contributors concerned about anonymity, a step-by-step guide to sending untraceable payments via Monero. The Bitcoin and Ether wallets listed on Meduza's website held crypto worth around $230,000 at current prices, according to on-chain data.\n\nWake-up Call\n\nSvetlana Reiter is one of Meduza's reporters who moved to Riga after the invasion. In the two weeks after she arrived, she had three sources effectively block her on messaging apps. Reiter thinks it's proof \"that everyone is nervous now\" to talk to exiled media. Even so, Meduza reporters still participate on Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov's daily conference call.\n\nThe disruption served as a wake-up call for her about how precarious journalism has always been in Russia, where nearly 60 reporters were killed over the last three decades.\n\n\"For a moment, I think we forgot we are living in this really strange reality,\" Reiter said.\n\nThose remaining in Russia face intimidation and worse. Shortly after Novaya Gazeta was shut, Muratov was attacked by two men on a train with red paint laced with acetone. In another incident, Ekho Moskvy's long-time editor Alexei Venediktov posted images of a pig head left outside his apartment with an antisemitic sticker.\n\nFor Meduza, which was founded in Riga in 2014 during a previous media crackdown following Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, the funding freeze wasn't the first time it had to change its business model on the fly. When Russia designated the site a \"foreign agent\" last year, in a move that requires it to post a bulky disclaimer on every article and social media post, advertising revenue evaporated overnight.\n\nNow Russia is considering an expansion of its law on foreign agents to allow the designation to be used even if individuals or groups don't get funding from outside the country. Russia has designated scores of independent groups, journalists and activists under the existing legislation, first passed a decade ago.\n\nThe restrictions have also impacted international media in Russia. Bloomberg News suspended newsgathering in Russia. Bloomberg LP, parent of Bloomberg News, later suspended all operations in the country.\n\nSome news organizations funded by foreign governments were tagged as foreign agents.\n\nMedia Hub\n\nWith Russia increasingly off limits, Latvia, a Baltic country of about 2 million with a large Russian speaking population, has become a hub for exiled media.\n\nIts capital Riga has become one of the main destinations, together with Tbilisi in Georgia and Istanbul, for Russian journalists seeking to escape Putin's censorship after a law passed that carries a sentence of as much as 15 years in prison for spreading \"fake\" news about what the Kremlin calls a \"special military operation.\"\n\nOutlets including Deutsche Welle and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty have relocated their Russian services there, while Novaya Gazeta's new European offshoot will be published in Riga.\n\nJamie Fly, the chief executive of U.S. government-funded RFE/RL said the restrictions will make them rely more on freelancers and user-generated content, methods they've used in other countries including Iran, and could undermine attempts to reach their audience.\n\n\"You can't just push out a URL and assume everyone's gonna come to it and watch that livestream of a program,\" Fly said.\n\nFor now, Meduza is raising about half of what it needs to develop, forcing it to live hand-to-mouth, according to Kolpakov, who declined to disclose how much in donations it brings in.\n\nAnd the site's reporters are still adapting to their new home outside Moscow. Alexey Kovalyov, Meduza's investigative editor, can no longer meet with high-ranking government sources in person, and he's no longer convinced his stories will change Russians' minds.\n\nHe's doing the work now for some day in the future when he hopes there will be a Russian war crimes trial. The shift in his mindset was only made more salient when Kovalyov's friend, Russian reporter Oksana Baulina, was killed reporting from Kyiv.",

          "Law Decoded: Crypto retirement plans get hot with Warren and Lummis making their moves, May 2-9, 2022  By Cointelegraph",
        body: "Retirement plans still largely remain at the periphery of both crypto adoption and the regulatory discussion. But last week, a major development emerged in this department. United States Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Tina Smith of Minnesota became concerned about Fidelity's recent announcement of adding Bitcoin (BTC) to its clients' 401(k) retirement investment menu. In a letter to the company's CEO Abigail Johnson, the lawmakers expressed their uneasiness over a \"conflict of interests\" and the \"significant risks of fraud, theft and loss,\" requesting from Fidelity a detailed outline of risk mitigation actions.\n\nCrypto 401(k) plans are still relatively rare, but they have already drawn suspicious attention from the U.S. Department of Labor. Crypto retirement investment does have its allies in high places, though. In response to Warren and Smith's letter, Senator Tommy Tuberville from Alabama has unveiled a new bill titled the Financial Freedom Act to allow Americans to add cryptocurrency to their 401(k) retirement savings plan unencumbered by regulatory guidance.",

          "Council Post: Are Multisensory Experiences The Next Frontier Of Building Brands In The Metaverse?",
        body: "Expertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author.\n\nRadhika Duggal is the CMO at Snapcommerce and a financial services and healthcare leader focused on Gen Z & millennials.\n\nWe've all heard the phrase \"perception is reality.\" Each of us as consumers perceives our world differently. The individual reality we each see is just that -- individual -- and it changes from one person to the next.\n\nJust what are perceptions, and why does it matter that they differ from person to person? To understand this, we should first discuss the basics of perception:\n\n* Perception is the way consumers select, organize and interpret the world around them. It affects how we see and what we feel about our surroundings -- including the companies and brands we purchase from. As marketers, we make an active effort to cultivate that perception. For example, Dunkin' Donuts did this by using scent machines to periodically infuse buses with the fresh aroma of coffee when the brand's jingle played on the radio.\n\n* Perceptions are affected by stimuli, which are essentially any unit of input into our senses. Sensory receptors (eyes, ears, tongue, nose and skin) connect with sensory stimuli (sights, sounds, tastes, smells and textures) around us. We evaluate and interpret these perceptions, and we either store or forget them.\n\n* I've found that consumers act on and react to the basis of the perceptions they evaluate and interpret -- not objective reality -- which makes the process described above incredibly important. Prior to Covid-19, marketing had evolved to include multisensory, in-real-life experiences. In my opinion, that's because these experiences that appeal to more senses tend to be more effectively perceived and recalled. As the pandemic becomes endemic, we're starting to see multisensory experiences on the rise. For example, the Dior Garden pop-up celebrating the new Miss Dior was a five-day experience offering cafes and an immersive flower installation. It was certainly an experience for all five senses.\n\nUntil now, we've been shaping perceptions both online and offline through digital Web 2.0 experiences as well as in-person activations. But, with Facebook's October 2021 announcement that it would rebrand to Meta, the metaverse burst onto the scene and could provide marketers with a whole other universe in which to create multisensory experiences, shape perceptions, and drive recognition, recall and ultimately purchases.\n\nNowhere is this more prevalent than with luxury fashion. For example, digital-first luxury sneaker brand Cult & Rain held its first presale in February and built hype through NFTs. To build hype, the \"Genesis Drop,\" as it was called, was made of a limited number of NFTs that could be purchased and then redeemed for an identical pair of high-end sneakers. The company would then make the shoes in its Italian factory, a process which could take 16 weeks. With Gucci Vault, a self-proclaimed \"constantly evolving emporium of wonders,\" Gucci partnered with 10KTF, a digital accessories shop co-founded by Mike Winkelmann, aka \"Beeple,\" who sold \"Everydays: the First 5000 Days\" for $69.3 million. It is one of the most expensive NFTs sold. Together, they customized 11 NFTs inspired by Gucci collections. These digital outfits essentially dress selected NFT collections, including Bored Ape and World of Women. Balenciaga partnered with Fortnite to enable players to purchase digital outfits similar to real-life Balenciaga fashion from a virtual boutique. People could collect the brand's Triple S Sneakers by playing the game, and players could even take advantage of virtual changing booths to try on Balenciaga clothing.\n\nWhat do all of these examples of shaping perceptions in the metaverse, the potential next frontier for brands, have in common? They primarily appeal to two senses: sight and sound. I've found that it's easier to perceive and recall experiences that include more than just sight and sound. But how do brands tickle more of our senses in the metaverse? Here are three examples of how technology could effectively shape perception in the metaverse by appealing to more than simply sight and sound:\n\n* Haptic gloves will bring touch. They'll do so by pushing against your skin each time you touch a virtual object in the metaverse. While there are a number of companies working on this technology, one of the most notable is Meta, which showcased its technology in November 2021. The gloves simulate touch through actuators which are, put simply, pads that create pressure on your hand. The project has been in the works for more than seven years.\n\n* OVR Technology will bring scent, which its website says \"makes virtual experiences more engaging, more immersive, more emotional, and more effective.\" It will do so through a small device that can be attached to VR headsets.\n\n* Taste is not far behind. With Taste the TV, a lickable TV screen that can imitate food flavors, consumers may be able to lick a hygienic film over the TV screen to simulate tastes. It works by using 10 flavor canisters that spray various combinations on the surface to simulate various foods.\n\nAre technologies like these ready for brands to leverage to deepen perception-building efforts in the metaverse tomorrow? In my opinion, no: But, given the prevalence of the metaverse, the focus on accelerating technologies like these will be very likely to rise. One thing is for sure: Gone are the days of companies talking at consumers. Whether they're interacting in the physical world, online or in the metaverse, consumers seem to be demanding a dialogue. I think the most successful dialogues will be multisensory experiences that are designed to holistically appeal to our sense of sight, taste, touch, smell and sound so that brands can improve their chances of building and shaping positive perceptions.\n\nForbes Communications Council is an invitation-only community for executives in successful public relations, media strategy, creative and advertising agencies.

        title: "Where To Buy Bitcoin At 26% Off Regular Price",
        body: "Here's a scorecard on eight ways to own crypto. The most intriguing: a low-cost coin trust available at a nice discount.\n\nAre you interested in virtual currency, now trading at half the price it had last fall? Shop around. Among the many ways to get a piece of the action, there are wide differences in ownership costs. My favorite: a somewhat obscure bitcoin trust to be found in Fairfield, Connecticut.\n\nThere are pros and cons to every means of getting cryptocurrency exposure, including the little outfit in Fairfield. This survey covers eight bitcoin bets in descending order of my views on their desirability. You may have a different ranking, especially if you are speculating on a quick turnaround.\n\n#1. Osprey Bitcoin Trust\n\nThis quasi-fund (ticker: OBTC), created a little over a year ago, is a knock-off of the much better-known Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. Both trusts are closed-end, in that investors have no right to redeem shares in return for cash or underlying assets.\n\nOsprey is a lot more cost-efficient, with an annual expense ratio of 0.8% versus Grayscale's 2%. These expense figures incorporate both portfolio management and custody costs.\n\nThe trusts trade at discounts to the value of the bitcoins they hold: recently 26% at Osprey, 28% at Grayscale. With either, you are making a bet both on crypto and on that discount. If the discount widens, you're worse off than you would have been with a coin purchase. If it narrows, you have a windfall.\n\nWhat might widen the discounts: a continued fall in crypto prices. Bear markets have a way of doing double damage to closed-ends, depressing their share prices even faster than prices decline on the assets they hold. That's been true of stock funds since the Great Depression and it's likely to be true of crypto trusts.\n\nIt's happening right now. A 12% fall in bitcoin between Friday afternoon on May 6 and Monday afternoon precipitated a 16% fall in Grayscale's price.\n\nBut the discounts might go away. That would happen if the Securities & Exchange Commission permits exchange-traded funds to hold virtual currencies. Both Grayscale and Osprey have vowed to convert their closed-end trusts to ETFs as soon as such things are allowed.\n\nThe ETF structure allows market makers to cash in unwanted fund shares (or buy new shares when shares are sought after) via a swap for underlying assets. That sets up an arbitrage that keeps an ETF's price close to the fund's net asset value.\n\nSo far the agency has rejected every application for a coin ETF, although last year it did greenlight an ETF that holds bitcoin futures contracts. Why the distinction? The futures trade on the heavily regulated Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while coins trade in somewhat murkier venues.\n\nA bearish view of coin trusts comes from Tyler Odean, publisher of Something Interesting, an insightful Substack newsletter on crypto. \"The time horizon [for an SEC approval] is long,\" he says. \"Between now and then the discount is likely to deepen as the number of competitive ways to hold bitcoin also deepens.\"\n\nStill, I think the bet in favor of an eventually favorable ruling from the regulators is a reasonable one. Risky, yes, but not as risky as the underlying asset. It's far more likely that bitcoin will crash another 50% than that the discount will make a comparable move from 26% to 63% (meaning: Your trust collapses from 74 cents on the dollar to 37 cents).\n\nOne more concern: liquidity. Osprey has but $100 million of coins in its vault, and its average daily share volume over the past year would be worth $400,000 at today's share price. Big bettors have to step in cautiously.\n\nYou can purchase bitcoins on an exchange, then have them exported to your cold-storage wallet. Market analyst Odean has used this for his long-term bets.\n\nPros: no counterparty risk. No management fee. If you do it right, no hacker risk.\n\nCon: You might not do it right.\n\nSelf-storage entails a fairly elaborate procedure to protect your private key from being lost or stolen. Next week you might walk into an open elevator shaft, so you need some mechanism for survivors to retrieve that key. The computer you use to generate the private and public keys for your coin repository has to be permanently isolated from the internet. The medium on which the secret is stored must be secure; Odean mentions an etched piece of metal as an option.\n\nThere are services (Casa, Ledger and others) that make this process less painful, but ease of use comes with some increment of risk.\n\nYou could leave your coins for safekeeping at a coin exchange. If you want that asset segregated, and thus safe from the exchange's creditors, you'll have to pay a custody fee.\n\nAt Coinbase Global, where the minimum account size for this service is $500,000, the fee is 0.5% a year. Some customers get a better deal. Osprey, which recently switched its custody from Fidelity Investments to Coinbase, appears to be paying 0.25% or less (its financial statements don't reveal an exact amount).\n\nIf you can stomach some counterparty risk, or you just want assets available for trading, you can leave your coins in a deposit account at no charge. This is the crypto equivalent of keeping your Tesla shares in a margin account. But, unlike stocks at a brokerage firm, coins left with an exchange have no Securities Investor Protection Corporation to back them if the middleman gets into financial trouble.\n\n#4. Foreign ETF\n\nWhile our SEC bides its time, the Canadian regulator has authorized exchange-traded funds that hold cryptocurrency. One of them is the Purpose Bitcoin ETF, which holds coins now worth just over $1 billion.\n\nPro: The fund trades at very close to net asset value. The shares that are quoted (in Toronto) in U.S. dollars see $4 million of average daily volume.\n\nCons: The 1.5% annual expense ratio is a lot higher than Osprey's. It's not easy to get your hands on these shares in the U.S., as most brokers will refuse the buy order. On the Fidelity platform you can find Purpose under the ticker BTCC_U:CA, but it takes some digging.\n\nPro: Liquidity. This trust has $20 billion of coins and sees an average daily share volume now worth $140 million.\n\nCME Group's Chicago Mercantile Exchange lists bitcoin futures contracts, each for five coins. Trading volume, almost all of it in the nearest month, typically runs to $1 billion a day. Settlement is in dollars; no wallets are involved.\n\nPros: good liquidity, minimal counterparty risk and the potential for leverage. You can control $2 of crypto by putting down $1 of cash.\n\nCons: taxes, trading costs and contango. Bitcoin futures share these three afflictions with many commodity futures.\n\nAt tax time you have to declare paper gains and losses on futures, with 40% treated as short-term (at high tax rates).\n\nRolling over your futures position monthly, which you probably would do in order to stay in the most actively traded contract, will cost you 12 commissions and bid/ask spreads per year.\n\nThe contango is a big deal. It means that the futures price at which you're buying is at a premium to the spot price. On bitcoins the contango is a volatile number usually falling between 3% and 6% annualized. Contango reflects both the cost of financing a stockpile of a commodity and the cost of securing it. In the case of crypto, securing the asset against hackers is not simple (see #2 above).\n\nFutures aren't bad for day-to-day trading. They are a poor choice for someone hoping to achieve a long-term gain.\n\nThe ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) holds long positions in bitcoin futures. Here, atop the steep contango of the Chicago trading pits, you have the opportunity to fork over an additional fee: the 0.95% a year assessed by the fund.\n\nProShares has attracted $900 million for this product. From naïfs.\n\n#8. MicroStrategy\n\nChairman Michael Saylor has turned this business analytics firm into a crypto betting parlor. The corporation has used mostly borrowed money to acquire 129,200 bitcoins.\n\nThe stock had an interesting day May 9. With bitcoin down 14% from where it was Friday afternoon, MicroStrategy shares went down 26%.\n\nTyler Odean sees these shares as a simultaneous bet on three things: crypto, a mediocre software business and Saylor's ability to withstand margin calls. He likes the first bet but not the other two.",

          "Yuga Labs' Otherdeed NFT sells for a record $1.5 million By BTC Peers",
        body: 'In the buildup following Yuga Labs\' recently concluded Otherside metaverse mint, one of the rarest virtual lands from the collection has sold for a whopping $1.5 million.\n\nOn Sunday, Otherdeed #59906 was sold on the NFT marketplace X2Y2 for 625 ETH. The said piece, which is the eighth rarest land on the Otherside metaverse, was purchased by n0b0dy.eth, who had earlier minted it for 305 Apecoin (or around $6,000) a week ago.\n\nWith the floor price of Otherdeed NFTs being at around 3 ETH ($7,200) at the time of purchase, it means that n0b0dy.eth paid a massive premium for the piece of virtual land. The move is undoubtedly linked to the rarity of the land.\n\nIn addition to being ranked 8th by rarity on Rarity Sniper, Otherdeed #59906 also contains a 1 of 1 artifact that was featured in the official Otherside trailer.\n\nAs reported by BTC PEERS, Yuga Labs issued 55,000 "Otherdeed" NFTs in late April, raking in over $320 million from the sale. The figure places the Otherdeeds mint as the highest gross for an NFT project to date.\n\nAnother 45,000 Otherdeeds were issued to holders under the Yuga Labs ecosystem, with 10,000 claimable by Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) holders, 20,000 by Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) holders, and 15,000 reserved for Yuga developers and others helping to build Otherside.\n\nIn total, Yuga Labs will be releasing 200,000 Otherdeeds. The remaining 100,000 will be used to reward so-called "Voyagers" who hold Otherdeeds and contribute to the development of Otherside.\n\nAlthough the details of Otherside still remain sketchy, Yuga Labs has disclosed that it is working with Animoca Brands (the parent company of The Sandbox) and Improbable on the project. Improbable said in its recent blog post:\n\nOtherside blends mechanics from massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) and Web3-enabled virtual worlds. In partnership with Improbable, the metaverse technology company, Yuga Labs aims to create a MetaRPG universe where the players own the world, where any NFT can become a playable character, and thousands of people can play together at the same time.',

As of now, SHIB trades at a price of $0.0000168, and this marks a seven-month low on Monday.\n\nFor days, the global crypto market has been following a downward trend, where Bitcoin and many other altcoins plunged into a dreadful state. Bitcoin itself is trading low at a 50% dip from its all-time high of $67,802.3 in November 2021. Currently, BTC is registered at $33,171.98, with a 5.17% down in the past 24 hours.\n\nMore significantly, as the BTC price is trading low, all the altcoins including SHIB are in a FUD. SHIB reached its all-time high (ATH) at $0.000088, in October 2021. But later on, it started a downtrend in monthly performance. Despite SHIB's frequent seesaw of price, it has been gradually moving down since May 6, which if continued would be a great blow to the SHIB traders.\n\nAdditionally, when the crypto market was down in April, SHIB had a bullish performance at $0.0000301, whereas many other major altcoins plunged.\n\nNotably, the team behind Shiba Inu had launched a burning portal to lower the circulating supply of the token and also to reward the token holders with yield-generating tokens. According to the data shown in Shibburn, SHIB Army has burnt over 410 trillion tokens from its initial supply.",

        title: "Crypto exchange KuCoin raises funds at $10 billion valuation",
        body: 'KuCoin\'s valuation has surged to $10 billion in its first financing round in four years as the global cryptocurrency exchange looks to make a deeper push into broadening its web3 ecosystem, it said Tuesday.\n\nThe Seychelles-based firm said it has raised $150 million in a pre-Series B financing round led by Jump Crypto. Circle Ventures, IDG Capital and Matrix Partners also participated in the new round, KuCoin said.\n\nThe four-year-old platform is valued at $10 billion in the new round, up from $100 million following its $20 million Series A in November 2018, KuCoin chief executive Johnny Lyu told TechCrunch.\n\nKuCoin, which has amassed over 18 million users in 200 countries and regions and is one of the largest exchanges by daily SPOT trading volume, plans to invest the fresh funds in broadening its portfolio of crypto wallets, GameFi, DeFi, and NFT platforms and DAOs, Lyu said. "This is how everyone is brought into the ecosystem, and the value of the ecosystem in turn depends on the size and loyalty of these participants," he said.\n\n"This concept is essentially why we raised this round, web3 is about openness, and we want to build KuCoin into an open ecosystem and an open system needs to bring many friends on board. The world of crypto is so new that we want to make sure we can leverage all sources of information to guide our decision making, and these prominent investors can keep us updated on the latest trends," he said.\n\nThe firm, which competes with Binance, Coinbase, FTX and Crypto.com among others, has been exploring opportunities in the web3 ecosystem for some time. Late last year, it launched its investment arm, KuCoin Ventures, through which it makes both strategic and financial investments.\n\nLyu said the venture arm\'s asset under management has already ballooned to a "couple hundred million US dollars."\n\nKuCoin has gained some popularity - as well as notoriety - for listing tokens with small to mid-sized market cap. One of the popular ways some savvy traders made good profits earlier was heavily making bets on the new KuCoin was about to list, and selling them as soon their trading went live on the central exchange.\n\n(Theoretically, especially during a bull cycle, retail investors stand a chance to make good profits on such tokens as well. Because their market caps are too low, compared to those listed on Coinbase and Binance, the on-paper growth upside is higher.)\n\nLyu said providing users with high-quality potential projects is "one of our major strategies at KuCoin and one of the reasons why we are known as \'People\'s Exchange.\'"\n\n"As you can see, KuCoin, as the home of hidden gems, not only keeps track of real-time hot sectors in the industry but also deeply researches potential projects in various sectors all the way, even if it is a small or mid-cap token at a certain stage," he said. "For example, we have listed many new projects in the world premiere way no matter through the normal listing or KuCoin Spotlight, KuCoin BurningDrop, in which many projects are turned out to be very high-quality and potential after a period of development. The premise of guaranteeing its huge potential and quality is that we have professional, all-around, and strict related processes."\n\nThe firm said it has seen an increase in demand for centralized services over the years, but is committed to catering to users who also wish to avail some decentralized services.\n\n"We noticed that some users would prefer to use DEX because it can be directly integrated with the wider crypto native ecosystem. Actually, we are exploring and developing decentralized products like the NFT marketplace - Windvane. In addition, KCC, jointly built by members of the KuCoin community and KCS fans, will also be an important aspect for KuCoin to build a decentralized ecosystem, with DEX and other protocols such as lending and stablecoins are building on it. We also have a P2P service for users who wish to convert fiat currencies to digital assets with the lowest fees and a high level of security," he said.\n\nThe exchange is also working to step up its efforts to support global regulation requirements and is investing to enhance its security and risk management systems, it said.\n\n"KuCoin provides a comprehensive platform of crypto services to a global audience, which is one of the many reasons we\'re proud to lead this round," said Tak Fujishima, Head of Asia at Jump Crypto, in a statement. "We are pleased to support the company as it continues to grow and expand its offerings in futures and margin trading, lending, staking and passive yield generation to support the growth of web 3.0 and the crypto markets."',

          "Is an Energy-Efficient PoS-Based Blockchain Possible? By CoinQuora",
        body: "As cryptocurrency becomes increasingly mainstream, the energy usage of some of the largest Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains, like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash, has come under intense scrutiny. Not only have some of the most influential people in the world expressed their concern over the environmental impact of PoW, but entire countries have moved to ban crypto mining altogether. So, what's the alternative for a sustainable blockchain business? Is an energy-efficient PoS-based blockchain possible? Let's take a closer look.\n\nHow Proof of Work (PoW) Works\n\nIn the blockchain world, to prevent errors such as fraudulent transactions or double spends, there has to be a consensus mechanism that allows all the nodes in the network to agree on the accuracy of each transaction before new blocks are added to the chain. On the Bitcoin network, this consensus is reached through a mechanism called Proof of Work (PoW). PoW relies on an energy-intensive practice called mining in which participants (known as miners) solve highly complex mathematical equations by lending vast amounts of computational power to the network.\n\nThe energy that PoW-based blockchains require to sustain them is so significant that the Bitcoin blockchain alone has an annual carbon footprint comparable to that of a medium-sized country. Just one Bitcoin transaction consumes as much power as an average American household over a 74-day period. As an entire ecosystem of more than 13,000 cryptocurrencies emerges, it's clear that PoW is no longer an option moving forward.\n\nThe Environmental Impact of PoW\n\nUntil recently, around two-thirds of all Bitcoin mining was carried out in China where abundant low-cost energy and favorable climatic conditions made the practice worthwhile. Yet, in June 2021, the Chinese government clamped down on crypto mining, banning all domestic mining operations; citing environmental impacts among their many concerns. As crypto miners began to flee to friendlier jurisdictions, the impact of mining's energy usage became even more apparent.\n\nIn Kazakhstan, where a mass exodus of Chinese miners fled, the power grid soon began to feel the strain, as sweeping power cuts rolled throughout the country leading to social unrest. In October 2021, the Kazakhstan government announced that it would be cutting off the power supply to crypto miners. In the US, now home to more than one-third of all crypto mining, Congress has begun to investigate the energy demands of crypto mining. In December 2021, Senator Elizabeth Warren expressed her deep concern over its environmental costs, sparking repeated rounds of congressional inquiries and a Committee Hearing on \"Cleaning up Cryptocurrency\". In the EU, a proposal to ban PoW crypto mining narrowly failed to win approval last month.\n\nESG investors also find their hands tied when it comes to investing in PoW-based blockchains because of their disproportionately high carbon footprint. Even previously, pro-Bitcoin advocates, like Tesla's Elon Musk, had been vocally critical of the \"rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions\".\n\nScalability Issues and Sky-High Fees\n\nBeyond the energy output of PoW-based blockchains, many popular networks, like Ethereum, are plagued with issues of scalability, lengthy transaction times, and sky-high fees. With the average transaction fee hitting almost $70 last year, many blockchain businesses built on Ethereum found the cost of user acquisition too high and were forced to suspend operations. One such project, UniLogin, posted a blog article announcing that it was shutting down. The opening sentence simply stated, \"Unilogin is out of gas\".\n\nIn other areas, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), traders are growing increasingly frustrated, as fees on popular platforms, like Uniswap, are pricing them out of the market, making DeFi a playground for whales. With thousands of decentralized applications (dApps) competing for throughput on one single base layer, the Ethereum chain is grinding under the strain. So, what's the solution?\n\nBlockchain applications built on PoW-based chains must seek a more viable alternative that can scale for mass adoption and accommodate a meaningful number of users. Blockchains, like Cellframe Network, adopt a different consensus method, Proof of Stake (PoS), that allows enterprises and developers to build dApps and blockchains that do exactly that -- while using a fraction of the energy.\n\nHow Proof of Stake (PoS) Works\n\nIn PoS, rather than miners lending computational power to the network, validators verify transactions based on the amount of the network cryptocurrency they own (their 'stake'). Validators validate the same percentage of transactions as their stake in the network. So, if a validator has 4% of crypto assets staked, they can only validate 4% of the blocks, serving to maintain decentralization in the system and removing the need to solve complex equations with vast amounts of energy. In PoS, no mining equipment is needed at all.\n\nAccording to a recent estimate, the planned migration of Ethereum from PoW to PoS could result in a 99.95% reduction in total energy use, making PoS around 2000 times more energy-efficient than PoW. For blockchain businesses that seek sustainability and growth, selecting a PoS-based blockchain, then, becomes an obvious choice. Yet energy output, speed, usability, and sustainability are not the only considerations to keep in mind.\n\nThe Threat of Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) Computers\n\nOne serious threat that is not given enough consideration by most existing blockchains comes in the form of quantum computers. In the not-too-distant future, a quantum machine will be able to crack current public-key cryptography and potentially threaten every byte of data known to mankind. Most blockchains will be unable to thwart this attack on their security. This highlights the need for PoS-based quantum-proof blockchains that are energy efficient -- and secure against any attack by a quantum computer of any size.\n\nThrough quantum-resistant cryptography, next-generation blockchains, like Cellframe Network, ensure that no algorithm can penetrate its network or the applications built on it, offering a scalable open-source platform secured by post-quantum encryption. Blockchain businesses can future-proof their brands while benefiting from fast, scalable, energy-efficient technology at their core.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWith the obvious shortcomings of PoW, energy-efficient PoS-based blockchains have emerged that allow enterprises and developers to expand for mass adoption. However, most PoS chains are not quantum-resistant and can't offer long-term security against the threat of quantum computers. For blockchain businesses seeking sustainability and longevity, they should build on a blockchain that is fully future-proof and will remain relevant in the post-quantum era.\n\nDisclaimer: CoinQuora does not endorse any content or product on its page.

        body: "Binance halts crypto derivatives in Spain and seeks regulatory approval.\n\nBitcoin Drops to 10 Month Low as Equities Market Tumbles\n\nDriven by the historic decision made by the United States Fed on Thursday to increase interest rates, the equities market recorded its biggest decline since March 2020. The price of Bitcoin fell in tandem with the stock market.\n\nSince Thursday, Bitcoin has lost more than 17% of its value. Bitcoin, which was priced at around $39,800 just after the announcement, hit an interday low of $32,813-its lowest value since June 2021.\n\nThe seven day price chart for Bitcoin (BTC). Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nSince its peak price of $68,789 in November 2021, Bitcoin has lost 52% of its value. Bitcoin's losses continue, as the world's largest cryptocurrency has dropped by 5% over the last 24 hours to now trade at $33k as of this writing.\n\nThe bearish pressure extended to the entire crypto market, seeing Ethereum lose 15% ove the last week, while Terra (LUNA) is down by 30%. As a result, the global crypto market cap has dropped from the $1.8 trillion recorded on Thursday, to just $1.5 trillion today.\n\nThe global crypto market cap over the last seven days. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nLuna Foundation Guard Lends $1.5B in BTC as UST Briefly Loses its Peg, Seeing LUNA Tumble\n\nThe market crash, which saw Bitcoin hit a 10-month low, also caused an unexpected twist of fate for Terra's algorithmic stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST). On Saturday, the UST lost its 1:1 dollar peg for a brief moment.\n\nThe price of UST briefly fell to 0.987 before bouncing back to 1.0 on Sunday. In order to protect the 1:1 dollar peg of the UST, the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) announced on Monday that it would be lending out $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin.\n\nThe LFG will loan $750 million worth of BTC to OTC trading firms as a way to help protect the UST peg. The other half (750 million UST) will be loaned out to accumulate BTC while market conditions normalize.\n\nThe token of the Terra ecosystem, LUNA, took the brunt of the news, and has lost more than 30% of its value since Thursday, May 5th. The price of LUNA fell from $87, down to as low as $58.6, and is trading at $60.17 as of this writing.\n\nThe seven day price chart for Terra (LUNA). Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nUST's brief 'de-pegging' came after a series of major withdrawals from Anchor Protocol, a lending market that offers high yield to users who deposit UST.\n\nSEC Halts $62 Million Investment Fraud Scheme from Mining Capital Coin\n\nOn Friday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that Luiz Capuci Jr., the CEO of Mining Capital Coin MCC) had been charged for planning a fraudulent global crypto mining and trading scheme worth $62 million.\n\nThe SEC charged Luiz Capuci Jr. and Emerson (NYSE:EMR) Souza Pire with selling unregistered offerings and mining packages to over 65,000 investors since their operations began in January 2018.\n\nAccording to the filing, MCC investors were promised 1% daily returns, paid weekly for up to 52 weeks. They were also promised payment in BTC, but were instead asked to withdraw their investments in MCC's own token, called capital coin (CPTL).\n\nCapuci was also charged with marketing fraudulent \"trading bots\", which he claimed was an additional investment platform. The SEC alleges that MCC hoarded a minimum of $8.1 million from the sales of mining packages, and $3.2 million in initiation fees.\n\nRegulators are enforcing stricter rules for cryptocurrencies as more cases of fraud and scams emerge in the crypto industry.\n\nInstagram Will Support Ethereum, Polygon, Solana and Flow NFTs\n\nIn March, Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg teased support for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Instagram, but didn't divulge any details. It has not been confirmed that Instagram will indeed support NFTs for crypto art.\n\nAccording to reports, the well-known social media platform will support NFTs from several major blockchain networks, including the Ethereum, Solana, Polygon and Flow blockchains.\n\nThe pilot program, whichcould begins as early as Monday, May 9th, will feature a small number of NFT enthusiasts from the United States. A wider roll-out will allow users to display NFTs on their profiles, link their wallets, and tag the creators of the NFT.\n\nThe increased corporate interest shown in the metaverse and Web 3.0 could be the key to the global adoption of non-fungible tokens.\n\nBinance Halts Crypto Derivatives in Spain and Seeks Regulatory Approval\n\nThe world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trade volume, Binance, has disabled its derivatives trading services in Spain as it looks to obtain a regulatory permit from the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV).\n\nAccording to local newspapers, Binance has paused its derivatives offerings in a bid to comply with the rules and eligibility standards set by CNMV, the 'National Securities Market Commission'.\n\nLa Informacion reports that Binance was asked to cease crypto derivatives trading by the CNMV (the agency responsible for regulating Spain's securities markets), and the Bank of Spain.\n\nThe derivatives drop-down menu on Binance Spain is now missing, but remains available in the global version. Binance has been in talks for licenses from the Bank of Spain and the securities regulator since January, but has previously failed.\n\nThe move aligns with Binance's effort to operate as a fully licensed financial institution globally.",

Initially this will be launched in the Philippines and will expand its reach into other regions.\n\nAcceptar Group, a Philippine cryptocurrency blockchain consulting firm, will assist P/E Capital in the development of their token and will provide technical and blockchain expertise to help their company transition into the full benefits of this technology.\n\nThe main goal of this project is to help Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW's) participate in hedge fund type programs with significantly lower entry requirements compared to traditional hedge funds that normally need at least $250,000 minimum to join so they can participate in programs and enjoy the same benefits without the initial entry requirement.\n\nAccording to P/E Capital CEO Eliseo Jojo L. Prisno, \"The future will be brighter for our OFW's through this program. The vision is to allow these OFW's to have a long-term investment that they can enjoy after their stint abroad. Many of them have worked for a very long time but are unable to save for their future. This will give these OFWs an opportunity that's usually available only to ultra-high net worth individuals.\"\n\nThe P/E Capital token called \"P/ECaT\" will create rewards based on their trading program. This will be the first Philippine hedge fund type project that will be backed by real-world assets of NASDAQ 100 listed companies in the electric vehicle ecosystem. The program which delivered a 37% equivalent yield captured last year's momentum in the EV sector with investments in Tesla, NIO Motors, General Motors, Ford Motors, Apple and Nvidia to name a few. The fund is now in its second year and will embark on an expanded distribution - this time through the blockchain.\n\nThis token will be minted as part of the custom tokens that Nekoin protocol will release within its compliance-centric ecosystem to provide more value to Filipinos worldwide.\n\nThe Remit.Save.Reward(RSR) Program will incentivize OFWs by delivering promotions and special offers whenever they remit money to their loved ones. RSR participants can enjoy zero remittance transaction fees, and senders can participate in the program so they can avail its rewards once they go home to retire.",

        title: "Tough Times Call For Smart And Empathetic Leaders",
        body: "During tough times, leaders need to step up. Your boss can make all the difference. When circumstances look dire, you want to be working for someone confident, who remains positive in the face of adversity, is empathetic to your concerns and has a game plan to navigate through treacherous waters.\n\nOver the last year, both novice and experienced investors bought stocks, bonds, bitcoin, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other cryptocurrencies with an almost reckless abandon, out of believing that the securities markets only go up and the fear of missing out on the rally that temporarily made many people more wealthy.\n\nHowever, the tides have changed. Nothing goes up in a straight line forever. The United States is at the beginning of what may be a new recessionary environment, accompanied by runaway inflation and upward price pressure on everything from food to fuel.\n\nThe stock and crypto markets are plummeting. There is real fear and near panic in the financial markets over how low prices will fall. The gains of the pandemic euphoria have evaporated within weeks. Venture capital funding may dry up. Stratospheric valuations of unicorn private startups may fall back down to earth.\n\nYou want to have a manager who can help lead during challenging times. If not, you may want to switch jobs. Here are some of the things you want to see in your manager.\n\nIn response to the sudden changes, companies will need to conserve resources, as they are not sure how long this new era of calibrating risk and securities prices and balancing the impact of runaway inflation and a likely recession. New product lines may be halted. Investments in new initiatives may be cut. After a huge hiring spree, business leaders will now need to consider whether they should curb hiring and commence downsizings.\n\nExperienced executives will recognize the pattern. The U.S. is moving from euphoria to fear and panic. They've seen this before in the dotcom bubble and burst in the 1990s, the aftermath of Sept. 11, the financial crisis and the initial shock at the start of the virus outbreak. Smart leaders understand that we are now in dire straits with a stock market plummeting and there is an existential risk of another World War. There are legitimate concerns over what is going to happen to the job market and economy. It's reasonable to conclude that the U.S. is in for a bumpy ride.\n\nA measure of someone's character is how they react under pressure. When things go awry, the flaws of managers are exposed. An important mindset and policy that empowers workers in tough times is when bosses offer psychological safety. This is the concept of providing the room and freedom to make their own decisions, and if they don't work out well, the manager doesn't hold anything against you. They understand that you tried your best, but the project didn't work out the way everyone would have hoped for. As long as you didn't do anything bad on purpose, you learned from the experience and will perform better in the future.\n\nIf your manager is quick to assign blame or scolds you in front of other workers, you know they aren't the right person to lead the team. Everyone will be afraid to take chances. They'll live in fear of being yelled at or punished for a simple misstep. This is the time to move on.\n\nAs revenues and profits decline, managers may panic. When this happens, they won't act rationally and will enact policies out of fear. Take the pulse of the management and executive team at your company. Watch closely what they are doing. Is their first instinct to fire and furlough people to save money and their own jobs? If so, that is a big red flag waving. This shows that the bosses are more concerned about their own career survival and not interested in the fates of their staff.\n\nJust like in your personal life, you've all seen people change when confronted with difficult changes in circumstances. It's the same at the office. The stress and worry get to be too much for some leaders and they end up unleashing their pent-up fear onto the workers.\n\nThis is demonstrated when a boss yells at and verbally abuses people in front of their peers, overreacts to a minor mistake or blames a person instead of owning up to the fact that it's the manager's fault. The supervisor may become a micromanager and overbearing in their demands. They may start pressuring people to work longer hours, revoke work-from-home privileges, cut compensation and indiscriminately lay off people. The promised raise, promotion and bonus are ignored. These and related actions create a toxic culture of fear and anxiety.\n\nIt makes it incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to do your job with all of the tension in the air. These are signs that you should consider looking for a job elsewhere, as the situation will likely disintegrate further as time goes on.\n\nIn a time of crisis, you want your boss to be on your side. They should offer words of encouragement. Their door is always open to holding a conversation. They'll reach out to their team individually to gain a sense of how they are holding up and ask what they -- and the company -- can do to make your life easier and better.\n\nA confident leader will lead by example. They'll acknowledge the challenges that need to be dealt with and offer a plan of action. A confident manager won't complain, point fingers or denigrate anyone. A solid supervisor will take responsibility -- good or bad. You want a manager and executive team that tells the truth, even when it's not pretty. They will share a clear vision to get through this time and continually readjust, as things change. Your boss should admit when they make a mistake, regularly show appreciation and gratitude to the team and ask for input and feedback.\n\nIf you love your job and want to stay at the company, but feel that your manager isn't handling the tough times well, you may want to schedule a meeting with them. Alternatively, if that option feels uncomfortable, get in touch with human resources or a more senior executive to help ameliorate the situation.\n\nThere may come a point in time that nothing is changing and the boss is only getting more tyrannical. When this occurs, you may start considering seeking employment elsewhere for both your mental health and career progression.",

Users will be able to display augmented reality NFTs on their IG stories, a featured that will be powered by Spark AR. He goes on to add that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) will roll out similar functionality on its platform in the near future.\n\nBack in January, BTC PEERS confirmed that Meta was working to enable support for NFTs on both Instagram and Facebook. The latest NFT test comes months after Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) enabled NFT profile picture for its premium users.\n\nOther social media platforms like adult-oriented subscription-based platform OnlyFans have also jumped on the NFT bandwagon. Similarly, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki hinted at the possibility of embracing web3 technologies, including NFTs, as a way to help creators make money.",

        body: "(Bloomberg) -- Stocks look set to come under more pressure in Asia on Tuesday as concerns about a darkening economic outlook sweep across global markets and bolster the dollar.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nEquity futures pointed to drops in Japan and Australia after U.S. shares slid to a 13 month-low. The technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 has shed about $1.5 trillion in market value after three days of heavy selling. U.S. contracts stabilized in early Asian trading.\n\nCommodities also tumbled, consigning the Bloomberg Commodity Spot Index to its biggest slump in two months. Crude shed about 6%, the most since March.\n\nTreasuries rallied and the yield curve steepened, reflecting haven demand and uncertainty over how far the Federal Reserve will hike rates to stem inflation.\n\nA dollar gauge is at the highest level since 2020, while China's economic slowdown amid Covid lockdowns is putting pressure on the yuan.\n\nIn cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin nursed a plunge, a retreat that's become emblematic of the ebbing liquidity that's curbing risk appetite.\n\nChina's woes, a global wave of monetary tightening and the war in Ukraine are casting a pall over the world economy. In a semi-annual report, the Fed warned of deteriorating liquidity conditions across key financial markets.\n\n\"The number one investment adage right now is don't fight the Fed, and I think the Fed is going up, they're going to hike,\" Victoria Greene, chief investment officer at G Squared Private Wealth, said on Bloomberg Television. \"There is no where to hide right now. If you are looking for green on the screen it is very minimal, especially in the tech sector.\"\n\nFed Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic said he favors continuing to raise rates by half-point moves rather than anything larger. He said the odds for a 75-basis-point hike are low but added he's taking nothing off the table.\n\nInvestors are awaiting the April U.S. consumer-price index print on Wednesday to gauge whether inflation is peaking.",

As told by the team at Compound, this represents the first time a major credit agency has issued a rating for an institutionalized DeFi protocol. The S&P Global Ratings' investment suitability scale ranges from AAA (extremely strong) to D (in default). A score of B- indicates the issuer can meet financial commitments, though vulnerabilities to business, financial and economic conditions persist.\n\nRegarding Compound's rating specifically, S&P Global cites the uncertain regulatory regime for stablecoins such as USD Coin (USDC), stablecoin-to-fiat convertibility risks and the Treasury's \"limited capital base\" along with a 4.00% per annum return obligation for the decision. However, the rating agency says that the Compound protocol's record of zero losses measured in USDC partially mitigates the risks of the offering.",

        body: 'As more individuals join the NFT market, a common complaint exists around the accessibility and user experience for non-crypto natives.\n\nBut Paper, a crypto-focused payments processing company launched in February, is working to make buying, using, and holding NFTs easier for the everyday customer or fan trying to buy a digital collectible, James Sun, co-founder and CEO of the company, told TechCrunch.\n\nJust a couple of months after launching, Paper closed a $7.3 million seed round after a $2 million angel investment for a total of $9.3 million in fresh capital, Sun said.\n\nThe round was co-led by Electric Capital and Initialized Capital with participation from Polygon, FalconX, Long Journey Ventures, ThirdWeb, Night Capital, and the founders of Plaid, Twitch, Fractal, MagicEden, Eventbrite, Tagomi and Bison Trails.\n\nPaper allows users to create wallets through their email addresses and purchase NFTs with credit cards (or crypto wallets) across the Polygon, Ethereum, Solana and Avalanche blockchains to provide non-crypto consumers a "frictionless" bridge for entry into the marketplace.\n\n"We view NFTs as a utility, instead of the easiest way to buy a [profile picture] project," Sun said. "Some of them have cool things like membership but we\'re most excited about the ones with utility instead of [a] collectibles [focus]."\n\nThe startup\'s new capital will be used for hiring, expanding the wallet\'s infrastructure and security, and making the product usable across more blockchains, Sun said.\n\nIn the past three months, Paper has worked with brands and artists like Fnatic, Deadmau5, Boohoo, and YesTheory to make NFTs more accessible through the option of buying them with a credit card and email.\n\nIn the future, it will roll out a software development kit, or SDK, which will allow white-labeling experiences for brand enterprises, Sun said.\n\n"The SDK we\'re building allows brands and developers to flexibly build a checkout experience that\'s uniquely theirs without the Paper logo," Sun said. "It will allow them to take the wallets we\'ve spun up for users and create a branded environment for that wallet so it only displays the NFTs for that brand, versus today where your wallet has all the different NFTs you have."\n\nWhile incorporating email addresses might feel more Web 2.0-focused, Sun said the team aims to maintain the interoperability of what crypto is supposed to be.\n\nSun said the Paper team consists of consumer technology-focused engineers from companies like NextDoor, Google and Twitch, to name a few.\n\n"Consumer experience is highly valued [to us], so we have a different philosophy from others," Sun said. "We\'re new to web3, we\'re not OGs or maximalists, but we have a different perspective and we\'re building on that experience."',

        title: "Argo Blockchain PLC Announces April 2022 Operational Update",
        body: 'Argo Blockchain plc, a global leader in cryptocurrency mining (LSE:ARB)(NASDAQ:ARBK), is pleased to provide the following operational update for April 2022.\n\nDuring the month of April, Argo mined 166 Bitcoin or Bitcoin Equivalent (together, BTC) compared to 163 BTC in March 2022.\n\nBased on daily foreign exchange rates and cryptocurrency prices during the month, mining revenue in April amounted to £5.52 million [$6.83 million*] (March 2022: £5.22 million [$6.92 million*]).\n\nArgo generated this income at a Bitcoin and Bitcoin Equivalent Mining Margin of approximately 75% for the month of April (March 2022: 74%).\n\nAt the end of April, the Company owned 2,682 Bitcoin, of which 235 were BTC equivalents.\n\nPromotion of Justin Nolan to Chief Growth Officer\n\nThe Company is also pleased to announce the promotion of Justin Nolan to the role of Chief Growth Officer. Justin Nolan was previously the co-founder and Chief Executive of DPN LLC, which initially developed the Helios project and was acquired by the Company in March 2021. After the acquisition, Mr. Nolan joined Argo as Vice President of Business Development, where he has been focused on the build out at Helios and on leading the Company\'s debt financing efforts. As Chief Growth Officer, he will continue to focus on long-term growth opportunities for Argo.\n\nPeter Wall, Chief Executive of Argo, said: "Following our stellar 2021 results, this month shows we are on course to strengthen our track record for the year ahead. Justin Nolan has played an integral role in making the opening of our Helios facility in less than a year possible. His promotion to Chief Growth Officer coupled with the facility\'s fast turnaround highlights our ambition to significantly improve our scale of operations and further our reputation as an industry leader."\n\nNon-IFRS Measures\n\nBitcoin and Bitcoin Equivalent Mining Margin is a financial measure not defined by IFRS. We believe Bitcoin and Bitcoin Equivalent Mining Margin has limitations as an analytical tool. In particular, Bitcoin and Bitcoin Equivalent Mining Margin excludes the depreciation of mining equipment and so does not reflect the full cost of our mining operations, and it also excludes the effects of fluctuations in the value of digital currencies and realized losses on the sale of digital assets, which affect our IFRS gross profit. This measure should not be considered as an alternative to gross margin determined in accordance with IFRS, or other IFRS measures. This measure is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, you should not consider this measure in isolation from, or as a substitute analysis for, our gross margin as determined in accordance with IFRS.\n\nThe following table shows a reconciliation of gross margin to Bitcoin and Bitcoin Equivalent Mining Margin, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, for the months of March 2022 and April 2022.\n\n(1) Due to unfavourable changes in the fair value of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Equivalents in March 2022 and April 2022 there was a loss on change in fair value of digital currencies.\n\n* Dollar values translated from pound sterling into U.S. dollars using the noon buying rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as at the applicable dates.\n\nInside Information and Forward-Looking Statements\n\nThis announcement contains inside information and includes forward-looking statements which reflect the Company\'s or, as appropriate, the Directors\' current views, interpretations, beliefs or expectations with respect to the Company\'s financial performance, business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future operations.

Zuckerberg, on Facebook, commented:\n\nHe also stated that the company would soon be bringing the same functionality to Facebook as well, in addition to integrating augmented reality with the NFTs to enable users to project them into 3D physical spaces in their Instagram stories.\n\nEarlier in January this year, Twitter enabled the option of displaying one's Ethereum (ETH)-based NFTs as their profile picture with a distinct frame.\n\nWhile Meta plans on doing this for free, Twitter made it available to its users for a fee of $3, which was criticized by many people, including current owner Elon Musk.\n\nCalling it a waste of engineering resources, the Tesla CEO even went to the extent of making a collage of BAYC NFTs as his own Twitter profile picture recently to show that the feature doesn't do much for NFT owners.\n\nIn line with the same, Musk tweeted:\n\nFollowing the social media giant, other platforms such as Reddit and OnlyFans also announced their intention to enable similar functionality.",

          "The metaverse is inevitable  --  we have been heading toward it for a long time. This is the good and the bad when the physical and virtual worlds collide",
        body: "Thanks to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, \"metaverse\" became such a buzzword in late 2021 that you couldn't miss it unless you lived under a rock. But the idea of the internet as a network of intertwined virtual worlds where humans spend most of their time is much older than Zuckerberg's vision.\n\nIn addition to the 1992 science fiction novel \"Snow Crash,\" whose writer Neal Stephenson coined the term, the metaverse was the topic of the dystopian novel/movie \"Ready Player One\" and inspired a number of articles including by venture capitalist Matthew Ball.\n\nMy most memorable moment in virtual reality (VR) happened in a few years ago. There I met an Iranian artist who walked me around her virtual gallery while we discussed the hardships that occurred to her post-Arab Spring and how it affected her work.\n\nI was able to hear her voice and see her avatar guiding me through the exhibition, which included both 3D interactive sculptures as well as her traditional artwork, including the surreal architecture we were navigating. The presentation ended with an opportunity to purchase one of her physical paintings we saw in the gallery. It was a wholesome and emotional experience I will not soon forget.\n\nI'm sure most of us have had similar experiences by now -- whether chatting with someone in a virtual environment or . However, on their own, these experiences aren't metaverse. Rather, they are fragments of it in the same way that one computer game or a search engine don't constitute the internet.\n\nThe internet that we currently experience is a sum of all our digital experiences tied together. It includes online services provided by governments, individuals and companies -- all siloed, yet intertwined and slowly coming together via unified search, authorization and authentication systems -- search engines and social login systems brought on by tech giants such as Alphabet GOOG, -2.23% GOOGL, -2.80% and, in the past, Facebook FB, -3.71% (now Meta Platforms).\n\nThe emphasis here is on mechanisms that tie all these experiences together. Because of the enormous effort put in it, mostly by Alphabet's Google, we now have the experience of a unified internet. It is this experience -- not siloed websites and services -- that helps us grasp better the concept of the internet and use it to its full potential.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why the company was able to pull this off. It has a massive user base that spans the globe (4.3 billion worldwide), which gives it a lot of data to work with in terms of understanding user behavior and preferences.\n\nAdditionally, Google has a wide range of products and services that can be used to connect third-party products and services. Finally, let's not forget enormous financial resources, which played a pivotal role for obvious reasons.\n\nAll these factors made the \"Sign in with Google\" authentication feature and Google as a search engine as ubiquitous as they are now. At this point, Google is the major global provider of seamless access to various world wide web services and an important building block of the present-day internet.\n\nIt's highly unlikely that any competitor will be able put in enough resources to dethrone the tech giant.\n\nWith the present belonging to Google, Meta's Zuckerberg knew he had only one choice: His company needed to seize the day and become the uncontested ruler of the internet of tomorrow -- the metaverse.\n\nTo the untrained eye, this battle has started recently. To those paying more attention, many of the recent investments -- even before the rebranding and public proclamation -- have been nothing but the building blocks for the metaverse.\n\nThe failed Libra has been transformed into ; first Oculus Rift, over multiple iterations, evolved into Meta Quest 2, which is now getting a premium upgrade and augmented reality (AR) capabilities with .\n\nFinally, there's the testing ground where all these concepts can be put together. A virtual world and social experience you can enjoy, an existing economy where you can spend and make money, and a hardware solution that allows you to seamlessly switch between two worlds, real and digital.\n\nIn his recent , Zuckerberg acknowledged that, just like with the modern-day internet, siloed experiences will coexist with Meta's infrastructure in the metaverse. He then made abundantly clear that Meta's endgame isn't to push out other platforms and creators. Rather, the business model aims to be a unifying force that puts all these concepts together and facilitates integration.\n\nThe goal is to empower creators as well as users and companies to seamlessly move between these experiences and for Meta to profit from providing the infrastructure.\n\nWith Facebook, Meta had learned that substantial financial gain can be made by selling user information and providing the environment in which advertisers and businesses can thrive. Taking its cut (which at the present time is ) from every transaction and selling advertising space will be a big thing for Meta in the metaverse. In that sense, the company is not only taking a page from Alphabet's playbook, but also perpetuating Facebook's business model.\n\nThere is another factor that plays a huge role in the adoption and success of the metaverse: the global socioeconomic backdrop.\n\nModern-day living is rife with crises, and chances are that things are going to get worse before they get better. The global workforce has all but been accustomed to working from home, and with wars and pandemics becoming a regular occurrence, there is less opportunity for human beings to actively pursue one of humanity's greatest needs: social interaction.\n\nAlthough environments and interactions experienced within virtual and augmented reality are a far cry from real-world interactions, the visual fidelity and technology behind them is getting better day by day. As options for real-world interactions become scarcer, people will inevitably flock to solutions that offer at least a glimpse of what freedom and companionship meant in the good old days.\n\nCombine all these factors with global adoption, substantial financial resources and a talented workforce, and it's easy to see how it's only a matter of time before Meta succeeds in accomplishing its lofty goal.\n\nSo, is this a good thing? Heck no. Humans have proven over and over again -- especially in recent years -- that when faced with danger and risk, we prefer convenience and escapism rather than facing the problem head-on.\n\nObviously, this creates the perfect foundation for deepening already present crises and walking back on centuries of adaptation and resilience. To make it clear, I'm not only talking about physical prowess, but also mental acuity driven by experiences in the real world, natural curiosity and freedom of thought.\n\nIn that sense, the metaverse could be a problematic, stifling environment. Here's one chilling scenario that could likely occur when the metaverse goes mainstream:\n\nIn time, we could have a growing number of individuals so accustomed to the virtual stimuli that they would show serious deficit of social skills when interacting with humans in the real world. As most of their experiences would be formed in controlled virtual environments, their perception of reality would become skewed as well. Due to the difference between real-world and digital interactions, these humans would increasingly lack adequate motor skills necessary to survive and thrive in the real world. It's no wonder they would prefer the convenience and blissful ignorance of the fabricated world, making use of their real-world bodies only to fulfill necessary bodily functions. In time, these individuals may have children who would follow in the footsteps of their parents, propagating the dependence on virtual worlds.\n\nNowadays we already have something similar in Japanese , and although the roots are different, the escapism is the same, and for these kinds of people, the metaverse simply offers more of it.\n\nBut let's not get ahead of ourselves. It's important to highlight that I'm not on an anti-progress crusade. However, I'm also not promoting escapism as a major way of coping with stress and challenges of daily life. Just like any tool, the metaverse can be good if used to facilitate certain interactions, such as remote work, gaming and creativity. However, it has to be used in moderation and in a way that supplements rather than replaces real life. Otherwise, a \"Matrix\"-like scenario could become increasingly common among the global population, leading us to a bleak, dystopian future where the digital environment becomes a gilded cage for the human psyche rather than a potent tool for advancement and improvement.\n\nWhat's your take on this? Let me know in the comment section below.",

          "Terra's Stablecoin Structure Unravels on a Wild Day LUNA's Collapse May Consign UST to Long List of Failed Algo Stablecoins",
        body: "The vulnerability in UST was plain to see from the outset. It was staring the market in the face.\n\nThe stablecoin's promise to redeem 1 UST for $1 worth of LUNA invited trouble. It was a trade that required a leap of faith in LUNA's resilience rather than the unambiguous support of hard reserves such as the dollar. And on May 9, that imbalance walloped investors when Terra's algorithmic stablecoin tumbled 40% to $0.61.\n\nWhile on Tuesday UST rebounded to about $0.90, the episode has delivered a blow to UST's credibility, and perhaps that of algorithmic stablecoins in general. The drama punctuated a day that seemed to finally dispel any hope that investors could dodge a punishing bear market. What happens next with Terra, a DeFi darling for the last nine months, will be an important bellwether as in a market that's lost confidence and is sown with panic.\n\nUST's slide was triggered when Terra's native LUNA token cratered and could no longer support its sister token. The troubles also followed $500M worth of UST positions being sold via the Terra-based Anchor protocol on March 7, which appeared to shake confidence in LUNA and its broader ecosystem.\n\nTerra previously promised that users could swap 1 UST for $1 worth of LUNA and vice-versa as a mechanism intended to maintain its peg. The design was supposed to iron out UST price volatility by incentivizing arbitrageurs to step in and trade the token should it move above or below the $1 level.\n\nWhile the price of UST has bounced back 50% from the lows on the back of $2.4B in volume on Binance alone, questions remain as to the viability of UST's design, and whether it may be destined to rest in the graveyard of failed stablecoin projects.\n\nThe Basis stablecoin, previously known as Basecoin, was among the first algorithmic stablecoin experiments in crypto.\n\nThe project began in August 2017 with a $133M funding round in April 2018 from leading venture capitalists, including Andreessen Horowitz, Bain Capital Ventures, and Lightspeed Ventures. Basis planned to issue bond and share tokens that would be used to expand and contract the token's supply and maintain its peg by incentivizing arbitrageurs to purchase or burn BAC depending on whether the stablecoin would be trading above or below $1.\n\nBut regulators stepped in and said the bond tokens were securities and demanded that the project collect detailed know-your-customer information and issue tokens solely to accredited investors.\n\n\"Unfortunately, having to apply US securities regulation to the system had a serious negative impact on our ability to launch Basis,\" a notice on the Basis website states. \"Although this isn't the outcome any of us wanted, we knew going into this that we were fundamentally making a binary bet on a favorable regulatory landscape.\"\n\nBasis returned the capital it raised to investors, and did not launch the protocol.\n\nLaunched in 2020, Empty Set Dollar described itself as an algorithmic stablecoin that would act as the reserve currency for the DeFi sector. It sought to build on the design planned for Basis, and was launched by an anonymous team to minimize the threat posed by regulatory intervention.\n\nThe protocol sought to maintain its peg by issuing additional tokens when its price rose above $1 to increase supply and dilute the value of already circulating tokens. By contrast, it would incentivize users to burn their tokens in exchange for debt coupons when the price fell below $1 to create scarcity.\n\nAlthough the price of ESD hovered near $1 during much of the fourth quarter of 2020, the token went into a death cycle in late December that year. ESD has consistently trended downwards since, last changing hands for just $0.005. It represents a 24-hour trading volume of just $26,310.\n\nIn November 2020, the seeming success of ESD inspired two anonymous developers operating under the pseudonyms 'Rick' and 'Morty' to launch their own homage to Basis.\n\nThe pair launched Basis Cash that month, distributing BAC tokens to users that locked up other popular stablecoins including DAI, USDC, and SUSD. The project issued bonds and share tokens to control supply and incentivize the destruction of tokens when needed.\n\nBut Basis Cash only traded near $1 for roughly two weeks, with the token steadily crashing more than 90% during the first six months of 2021. The token was last exchanged for $0.008, with BAC driving just $33,645 in volume over the past day.\n\nAmpleforth is another algorithmic stablecoin that took inspiration from Basis. Its peg is maintained by daily rebase events that adjust the supply of users' balances in a bid to maintain its price at $1.\n\nThe protocol launched in mid-2019 and quickly appeared destined for failure when the price of AMPL steadily sank to levels below $0.40 just three months later. But its price recovered, with AMPL trading close to $1 from November 2019 until mid-February 2020.\n\nAMPL experienced wild volatility in Q2 and Q3 of 2020 and since then it has continued to post dramatic swings between the roughly $2 and $0.70 range, seemingly undermining its utility as a stablecoin.\n\nAMPL has been less volatile in 2021, trading within a range roughly 30% of either side of $1. It is currently worth $1.10 and represents daily volume of more than $2.2M.\n\nThe recent success of UST has inspired rival networks to launch their own stablecoins backed by holders who may redeem and burn the token in exchange for $1 worth of a native network token.\n\nNeutrino USD (USDN) was launched on the Waves network in February 2022. But the protocol quickly became the subject of controversy, with a pseudonymous Twitter account alleging that the Neutrino team were pumping the value of WAVES and using the Vires money market protocol to prop up USDN's market cap in early April.\n\nA subsequent crash in the price of WAVES was accompanied by USDN quickly losing its peg. The token traded as low as $0.60 early last month, before largely recovering. But the token has failed to fully reclaim its peg, trading between $0.98 and $0.99 since.\n\nUSDN/USD. Source: CoinGecko\n\nOther UST-inspired stablecoins include Tron's USDD, which was launched last week, and Near's USN, which went live at the end of April. However, the extreme volatility suffered by UST evidences that volatile market conditions can quickly result in these algorithmic stablecoins losing their peg.",

        body: "Bitcoin was lower as expected as we collapsed from strong resistance at 40100/300 and were holding below the 100 week moving average at 36000 as I write -- for a very important sell signal.\n\nRipple had well and truly broken the 100 week moving average, now at 6700/6750.\n\nEthereum we wrote: bulls have defended the 500 day moving average at 2800/2750 all this week, but the failure to beat strong resistance at 2950/3000 I think will trigger a break below here now for an important sell signal. I am talking crash conditions.\n\nAs expected, we have broken lower for an important sell signal.\n\nBitcoin shorts at resistance at 40100/300 worked as prices collapsed to my targets of 37500/37000 and the important 100 week moving average now at 36000. THIS WAS MEGA IMPORTANT OVER THE WEEKEND. Holding below 36000 was a MAJOR SELL SIGNAL. First stop was 28900/700.\n\nObviously bulls need prices above 36000 as quickly as possible, preferably above 37000 to show they are back in control, targeting 38200/400. We should struggle to beat this level here, but a break above 38900 then targets 41500/42000.\n\nRipple remains very much in a bear trend and selling into resistance has been a successful strategy for us for a number of weeks. We have 9 month trend line support at 5680/40, with a low at 5800 so far as I write on Saturday morning.\n\nA break below here (and I would be careful if you bet against it) triggers further significant moves to the downside initially targeting 5100/5070. On a break below 5050I am looking for 4300/4250, just to start with.\n\nObviously, bulls desperately need prices above 6750 to get back in the game but this seems highly unlikely now.\n\nEthereum broke strong support at 2800/2750 and held below here for a medium term sell signal exactly as predicted, targeting 2640 (hit), 2600, 2570, and 2500 (just to start with).\n\nBulls obviously need prices above 2800 as soon as possible but I cannot see this happening. If I am wrong, look for a test of the 100 day moving average at 2900/2950. Shorts need stops above 3000. A break higher is a medium term buy signal.",

        title:
          "Asia Session: China Nerves Rattle Regional Equity Markets; U.S. Dollar Higher | Investing.com",
        body: "Asian equity markets are off to a bad start today, although the US dollar has been steadily rising versus Asian currencies, and the risk-sentiment barometers, the Australian and New Zealand dollars are having a tough day at the office. There is no one theme that is causing Asian equities to crater, but if I had to pick one, it would be that concerns over the depth of the China slowdown are accelerating, with virus restrictions tightening in Beijing and apparently, Shanghai once again.\n\nThe weekend G-7 meeting may also be darkening the mood, agreeing to enact a phasing out of Russian oil imports. The important words here are \"phasing out,\" which was enough to get Japan on board. The language was loose enough to have had little impact on oil prices today, which have fallen today as China slowdown nerves outweigh short-term supply shocks. The G-7 measures are more forward-looking. Still, Asia has a very high dependency on imported energy and the G-7 announcement is certainly not positive for Asia's growth going forward, implying higher for longer energy prices.\n\nFriday's US Nonfarm Payrolls rose by 428,000 jobs, not far from median forecasts. The headline number was not enough to juice up the Fed tightening narrative but was definitely not going to allow any hopeful rate hike doves their day in the sun either. The result was a gentle continuation pattern. US equities eased, the US dollar ground higher, and US yields also ground higher. The hump in the US yield curve is now gone with the 2-year to 30-year now back to positive and the 10-year yield now comfortably above 3.0% at 3.15%.\n\nSo, net-net, we are still in high inflation tightening Fed, China slowdown, higher energy, and food price environment, with the added uncertainty surrounding Russia's war on Ukraine, which Vladimir Putin may make official today at Moscow's May 9 parade. Little surprise, therefore, that Asian markets don't really want to play today.\n\nShortly we will receive the China April Trade data. It comes as new home sales plunged by 33.0% over last week's holiday period, and bankers seized a New York property of a defaulting China property developer according to Bloomberg. China's private developer leverage saga has been knocked off the headlines but remains a slow-moving train wreck that is also being exacerbated by the COVID-zero policy. There are downside risks in the import component which could flatter the headline, even as exports remain robust. Lower exports or imports or both will likely give the bears more fresh salmon for dinner.\n\nLater today, Indonesia releases its April inflation and trade data. Expectations are for an increase of 0.80% MoM, and 2.60% YoY, while the trade data should be robust, thanks to economic reopening and resource demand. A much higher inflation rate will increase the pressure on Bank Indonesia to hasten its reluctant hiking timetable. BI is struggling to cap USD/IDR at $14,500.00 at the moment and a high inflation print will see another wave of selling hit the Rupiah.\n\nLater this week, we have China and India CPI where the risks lie in opposite directions. A lower CPI than 1.50% YoY will increase the pressure on the government and PBOC to hit their stimulus buttons. That could be a short-term boon for Mainland equities, but actions speak louder than words, as even China is finding out. After an unscheduled rate hike by the Reserve Bank of India, if India's inflation moves higher than 7.0% on Friday, the pressure will be on for the RBI to act again. That may give some strength to the Rupee but is unlikely to be bullish for local equities.\n\nWe can expect some volatility in Philippine markets today as well with the presidential election taking place. It does look at this stage that this marvelous country will shake my faith in democracy and elect a Marcos as President, and a Duterte as Vice-President. Yes, you read those names correctly and yes politics in Asia as a family business is sadly, alive and well. I'm not sure how international investors will view that outcome, but I suspect the BSP's work is about to get harder in the months ahead. For me, if a Marcos is back in power, I'm looking to get long luxury handbag and shoe producers, who preferably accept cash and cryptos for payment. Let the people eat cake.\n\nIn the DM space, US CPI data on Wednesday is the week's highlight. Like the Nonfarm Payrolls, the outcome is binary. A much higher CPI print equals more Fed tightening equals a higher US dollar and lower equities. A much lower CPI equals a relief rally and a correction lower for the US dollar. CPI prints across the Western Europe heavyweights and the UK throughout the week could also ratchet tightening pressure on the ECB and BOE, although I think this will be in vain as the needs of a war-time economy rightly take precedence. That likely means euro and sterling are going to finish the week lower than where they started today.\n\nAsian equities are down heavily in the red today as regional markets react to tightening COVID-19 restrictions in China and fears of a prolonged slowdown in the world's second-largest economy. Friday's US Nonfarm Payrolls was enough to keep the Fed hiking narrative going and saw US yields lift across the curve pushing Wall Street lower. The S&P 500 fell 0.57%, with the NASDAQ losing 1.40%, while the Dow Jones eased by 0.26%. US futures have also slumped today, S&P 500 futures falling 1.50%, NASDAQ futures tumbling 2.05%, and Dow futures losing 1.25%.\n\nFriday's price action had set Asia up for a soft start anyway, but China's COVID-zero restrictions and news of slumping property sales during the holiday week appear to be spilling into a capitulation trade in the equity space across Asia. The Nikkei 225 is down just 1.45% today, perversely making it one of the best major market performers, along with South Korea's KOSPI, just 0.95% lower.\n\nEuropean and UK markets had an ugly day on Friday as Russia/Ukraine fears and higher gas and oil prices weighed on the region. A G-7 Russian oil ban won't help the mood and nor will the price action in Asia today. Additionally, there are worries that President Putin could use today's commemorative victory over Germany parades to declare all-out war on Ukraine, instead of a \"special operation.\" European markets are likely to hit the sell button repeatedly and not pass go when they arrive in the office today.\n\nThe US dollar booked some modest gains post-Nonfarm Payrolls on Friday, but the Dollar Index resistance zone at 104.00 held once again. The dollar index finished 0.11% higher at 103.66 having traded in a wide range intra-day. The risk aversion China slowdown price action seen in equities has spilt into currency markets today, lifting the US dollar after US 10-year yields closed comfortably above 3.0% on Friday. The dollar index has risen 0.34% to 104.00 and is, once again, making a determined test of resistance here. Support at 102.50 remains intact. A close above 104.00 will signal rapid gains to 105.00 and in the bigger picture, the technical picture still says a multi-month rally to above 120.00 is possible.\n\nEUR/USD and GBP/USD have fallen by 0.35% today to 1.0508 and 1.2290. EUR/USD support at 1.0470 is in jeopardy, while GBP/USD is threatening the Friday lows of 1.2275, having closed on support at 1.2325 last week. EUR/USD rallies above 1.0650 will be challenging to sustain now, with the 45-year trendline at 1.0800 now distant. Similarly, GBP/USD will run into headwinds between 1.2400 and 1.2500. The technical picture signals much lower levels for both and a formal declaration of war from Mr Putin against Ukraine today will signal a test of 1.0300 and 1.2000 in the coming days, if not sooner.\n\nUSD/JPY has crept higher over the past few sessions, rising 0.30% today to 130.95. With the Bank of Japan showing no signs of adjusting its 0.25% JGB yield cap, and US rates continuing to climb as the Fed gets busy fighting inflation, downside pressure on the Yen seems inevitable. Support lies at 128.50, but a rally by USD/JPY through 131.35 sets the stage for a move to the 135.00 area.\n\nPlummeting stock markets in Asia appear to be prompting heavy outflows from Asian currencies today, with USD/CNH and USD/CNY over 0.50%, as are the USD/THB and USD/INR. Elsewhere across the region, the US dollar has booked 0.30% plus gains versus the IDR, SGD, MYR, and KRW. Chinese officials have still not made overt noises about the pace of the CNY sell-off to 6.7050, despite setting a slightly stronger fixing today. USD/INR has traded at all-time highs around 77.255 today and has fallen around 1.80% since the RBI's last week.\n\nThat does leave the RBI in somewhat of a bind, and it is an issue the Bank Indonesia and others around Asia will be feeling sooner, rather than later. In the first instance, thanks to Asia's huge FX reserves, I expect some judicious \"smoothing\" to be the first strategy. Indonesia, the Philippines, and South Korea have already taken this route I suspect. If international sentiment continues to fall and the US dollar continues to gain, those noises may get louder, but ultimately, regional central banks will fight a losing battle if China remains comfortable with Yuan depreciation.\n\nOil prices booked modest gains on Friday night after an on-target US Nonfarm Payroll release suggested that the US economy continues to perform well. Brent crude rose 1.86% to $113.05, and WTI rose by 1.80% to $110.50 a barrel. China slowdown fears initially saw all those gains pared in Asia, but as the session has gone on, oil has clawed by most of its losses. Brent crude is down just 0.40% to $112.60, and WTI is down 0.55% to $109.85 a barrel.\n\nA proposed G7 ban on Russian oil imports has had zero impact on oil markets today, with China nerves taking precedence. Nevertheless, it seems inevitable that both the EU and Japan will be competing for more non-Russia supplies in the future, and this is underpinning prices. Soaring energy demand in India due to the heatwave, as well as tight natural gas markets, should mean coal, gas and oil prices remain self-supportive of each other.\n\nThat leaves oil at the mercy of the Ukraine/Russia conflict and the EU oil ban supporting the downside, while China's slowdown fears. Ukraine/Russia conflict risks will be sorely tested today if Vladimir Putin declares war officially against Ukraine at today's May 9 parade. I continue to believe that energy markets are under-pricing Russian risks, be it external sanctions, or Russia's potential response.\n\nBrent crude has formed a triple top at $114.75 a barrel, which will be a formidable barrier in the near term. Support lies at $103.50 a barrel and I am sticking to my broader $100.00 to $120.00 a barrel wider range ahead for now. WTI has resistance at $111.50 with support at 100.00 a barrel. Once again, I remain comfortable with a $95.00 to $115.00 a barrel outlook in the medium term.\n\nGold has eased by 0.50% today in Asia to $1874.00 an ounce, erasing Friday modest 0.35% gain. There are some constructive notes in gold's recent price action. It is holding up remarkably well versus a rampant US dollar and a US yield curve where a lot of it starts with three in yield terms. It actually managed to rise slightly on Friday equities fell and the US dollar rose. I suspect some of that support was derived from weekend risk-hedging, which has evaporated today.\n\nGold is definitely outperforming Bitcoin right now, which has tumbled through support at $37,400.00 on Friday and is trading much lower at $33.740.00 this morning. That should give the gold bugs heart but could also be coincident with the return of China from holidays, or suggestive that there is more than a little risk-hedging based buying quietly going through the market.\n\nGold looks set to continue vacillating around its 100-day moving average, today at $1882.50, in a wide but real range of $1850.00 to $1920.00 an ounce, for the time being. Risk aversion buyers supporting the downside, while US dollar strength caps rallies. Only failure of the break-out triangle apex at $1835.00 swings gold back into bearish territory. That said, gold needs to close above resistance at $1920.00, and preferably $1960.00 an ounce to signal a renewed structural move higher. I foresee more whipsaw trading ranges in the days ahead.",

        title: "My Crypto on ICONFi: Check exchange wallets at once",
        body: 'SINGAPORE, May 9, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- My Crypto service has launched on ICONFi, the hybrid Crypto savings and staking platform providing the highest compound yield rates on crypto savings. My Crypto allows users to add the API from crypto exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, supporting the users to check their balances at once. Easy and convenient.\n\nA crypto user would need to use different crypto exchanges simply because exchanges have listed different kinds of coins and tokens. There\'s a good chance many crypto Hodlers and traders would be struggling to check the balances of the exchanges they are using. This already sounds super bothering, and it is painful to multi-task through exchange apps to check the balances. My Crypto provided a solution to this problem.\n\nWith My Crypto service, ICONFi users can see the balances of different coins and tokens on different exchanges, making the crypto asset management super simple. And as this is Read-only API, the ICONFi app only shows the balance data while not having access to actual crypto assets. It would be also interesting to compare the ROI from the direct trading with ICONFi\'s Fixed savings compound interest rates.\n\nICONFi\'s Growth Lead Steve Cho said, "My Crypto service is expected to address the issue of dealing with many different exchange wallets. It also shows the total value of users\' crypto assets in BTC, making it easier to see how much crypto assets they have in exchange wallets and ICONFi wallets altogether." And he added, "Many ICONFi users put their BTC, ETH, USDT, and USDC on ICONFi Flexible account so that they can receive the basic interest rates, because it has no lockup period (withdrawal takes up to 24 hours though) while giving up to 3.5% compound interests, which is normally higher than other platforms\' Fixed savings with lockup periods. People always want to get the maximum profits out of their actions and ICONFi users just know this is the best option they can have without taking risks of lockup period because the crypto market shifts a lot. They know that if they sit their coins on exchange wallets, in fact they are losing value while taking the opportunity costs."\n\nICONFi\'s CEO Sean Kim said, "The vision of ICONFi is Make Crypto Simple - we want to provide easy and convenient crypto finance services to the entire crypto users." He added that "ICONFi is officially giving out the highest compound interest rates on BTC (without considering platform tokens) in the market and it is the only Crypto savings platform giving its users Fixed rates. All other platforms cut down the rates if users put more crypto, which sounds super absurd. Users deserve more yields if they put in more assets. We want to support any crypto user to get the most value out of their Bitcoin in an easy, simple, and convenient manner." Sean Kim has 11+ years\' experience in financial service consulting at PwC and Ernst & Young and expertise in financial system, derivatives, and investments. He also has been a financial engineer and mathematician.\n\nICONFi is a Hybrid platform providing both Crypto Fixed savings and Crypto Staking services. ICONFi provides the familiar ID and Passwords system while providing compound interests on Crypto savings and Auto-Staking features, positioning itself as an alternative to direct crypto trading. The website www.icon-fi.com has the interest calculator to see the details and expected interests on ICONFi savings accounts - it is always harmless to have more options, and ICONFi would be a good alternative if anyone understands the benefit of the compound interest system.\n\nWith the launch of My Crypto service, ICONFi announced a whopping 10 million USD worth of Fixed Savings events where users can receive the MAX interest rates for 28 days until the total event savings amount hits $10M. Check out the details from the ICONFi Medium Blog.\n\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/my-crypto-on-iconfi-check-exchange-wallets-at-once-301542342.html',

The use of tokens and nonfungible tokens (NFTs) could help unlock new business models. Meta's additional capital spending of $10 billion every year to build the data-center infrastructure for its metaverse is likely to support leading GPU makers, including Nvidia. Unity and Matterport, along with other design-software makers like Adobe and Autodesk, are exposed to demand for 3D software used to build the metaverse.\n\nMetaverse's revenue will come mostly from VR/AR, specialized servers for data centers and 3D design software over the next two years, while we calculate token-based transactions driven by NFTs and blockchain-based currencies can boost the market to about $140 billion by 2025. We see 3D virtual spaces used for shopping, events, social media, video conferencing and other consumer apps.",

        title:
          "The Modern Identity Stack:  Startup Opportunities In the $80B+ Identity Market",
        body: "I've spent more than a decade building infrastructure for managing digital identity. Before I became a Partner at Mayfield investing in early stage enterprise software companies, I was the CEO at Gigya, which created the Customer Identity & Access Management category starting back in 2011, powering login & registration as a service for 700 customers and becoming Forrester leaders in the space. Now as an investor at Mayfield, we've continued spending time on the Identity Stack, investing in Berbix (Instant Identity Verification), OwnID (Distributed Customer Identity Platform), and Vector Flow (Physical Identity & Access Management Platform).\n\nWhy so much focus on the Identity Stack? First, it's critical enabling infrastructure for digital transformation. Without being able to verify \"we are who we say we are\" and \"what we can access\", nothing online really works. Second, the Identity category has produced meaningful companies with more to come, including Okta's $16B market cap and Auth0's $6.5B acquisition. In fact, Okta claims an $80B total addressable market (TAM). But despite this, Identity is still very broken - I would even argue that identity is going through a renaissance of sorts, driven by megatrends including customer experience, frictionless security, & privacy. New enabling technologies like no code / low code, cross platform networks, and specialization are changing the way the markets work. The end result is massive opportunities for entrepreneurs.\n\nIn this post, I provide a primer on what the identity stack is, discuss the trends causing disruption and evolution, and share a viewpoint on where startup opportunities exist to build companies in the modern Identity Stack.\n\nThe identity stack is historically made up of 4 categories - Authentication, Authorization, Directory, and Identity Governance & Administration. Here's what these categories mean in plain English:\n\nAs employee and consumer expectations around customer experience, security, and privacy change, Identity is going through an evolution that is redefining the identity stack. Further, enabling technologies, including no code / low code, frictionless authentication like FaceID and FIDO2, and advanced security techniques are changing the landscape. Finally, there is specialization occurring in various use cases including B2E vs B2C VS B2B VS B2B2C.\n\nAll together, these changes are resulting in an evolving modern identity stack, where solutions are being redefined to keep end users - particularly developers, customers and employees - in mind. Further, these solutions are moving beyond just thinking about security requirements, to considering customer experience, privacy and security. To put this in context, I think about major categories of the identity stack moving up an evolutionary curve along 2 axis: 1) User Focus (e.g., IT vs Customers, Employees) and 2) Feature Focus (e.g., Security vs Customer Experience, 1st Party Data, Web3 & Privacy)\n\nPasswordless Authentication -> Many large companies have been built around the concept of services for authentication, including Okta ($16B+), Auth0 ($6B), Forgerock ($2B), and Ping Identity ($2B), but these companies were primarily architected around the concept of a password. The password is the bane of the internet. It's insecure and provides a broken experience for users. Good news! Passwords can now go away thanks to new enabling technologies like FaceID and FIDO2, enabling a much better customer experience compared to previous attempts that require physical keys (e.g., YubiKey), separate mobile applications, or magic links. Next generation companies range from those looking to replace the entire identity stack like Stych or Transmit Security to be passwordless, or those that are looking to distribute identity management into the hands of consumers like OwnID (Mayfield Portfolio Company). Both approaches have their merits, and it's likely that there will be numerous billion dollar next generation companies built in the passwordless authentication space.\n\nCrypto Wallet Login -> In the last decade, the big innovation enabling easy \"single sign on\" authentication into websites and applications was leveraging Social Login providers like Facebook and Google to easily sign in and register to any website or application. While still very valuable and ubiquitous, there is now a movement to take advantage of decentralization on the blockchain versus centralization on the big tech platforms. The big unlock here is the more mass availability of crypto wallets like Metamask, that can serve to authenticate users into websites and applications. As we saw with Social Login, new companies like Dynamic are emerging to provide crypto wallet login-as-a-service, aggregating the many crypto wallet providers and providing a single authentication API.\n\nSelf Service Admin Panel -> Identity Governance and Administration, or the onboarding and management of users, is a category of identity technology that has again produced large companies such as Sailpoint ($6B). Legacy vendors were primarily architected for employee oriented, low volume and high touch use cases. In today's world of consumer scale digital experiences and consumer grade expectations, previous approaches that required a manual touch to onboard individual users no longer work. New approaches will allow for complete self service, both by employees, customers, and the administrators that manage their accounts. Next generation companies working in this area are beginning to emerge, including companies like WorkOS and FrontEgg.\n\nInstant ID Verification -> Identity Verification (IDV), or the process of knowing someone is who they say they are, becomes a lynchpin enabling technology for moving previously offline transactions online, whether it's banking, telehealth, or e-learning. Big companies have been built here, including numerous unicorns like Jumio and Veriff. For almost a decade, first-generation digital identity verification technology companies have offered basic online services that confirm customers' identities by having them upload a selfie that a human screener, usually in a low-cost labor market, could compare to the passport or driver's license photo on file. But this can take minutes, is quite expensive, and people make mistakes. New IDV services leverage machine learning and automation to provide instant verifications without human involvement, dramatically improving customer experience and overall costs and enabling a whole set of new use cases to be possible. This is also replacing some of the traditional identity proofing mechanisms like the Knowledge Based Authentication (KBA) or Database Checks, that can be inconvenient and inaccurate. Next generation companies in this area include Persona and Berbix (Mayfield portfolio company).\n\nCustomer Onboarding & Management -> In the identity world the concept of the \"Directory\", or the system of record for user data, was brought about when IAM was primarily an employee oriented, IT concept. Microsoft Active Directory is the most commonly used legacy software in this category, with nearly all fortune 1000 companies as customers. Active Directory and other similar legacy approaches work great when use cases are focused on employee name, employee role, etc but doesn't work in today's modern customer oriented world where 1st party data, privacy & security are ultimate concerns, with a need to give users transparency & control over their data. Looking forward, the concept of a directory will be redefined, with a few principles in mind: 1) Enable the streamlined onboarding of 1st party customer data with no code / low code hosted UX forms, that would maximized data collection while obtaining the necessary identity, data purpose, missions, permissions etc securely; 2) Securely store & manage the customer 1st party data in the cloud, encrypting the data and ensuring the requisite data residency & privacy laws are met; 3) integrate & orchestrate the data into requisite relying systems such as CRM, Marketing, Advertising & Loyalty solutions. There are some early next generation companies starting to emerge here including User Flow, Heyflow, and Arengu.\n\nIdentity is a critical enabler to digital transformation and deserves the time and attention it's receiving from entrepreneurs and investors. Although Identity is made up of many long established categories - Authentication, Authorization, Directory, Governance & Administration - it's going through an evolution, driven by megatrends like customer experience, frictionless security, & privacy and enabling technologies like no code / low code, cross platform networks. The end result of these changing dynamics are a re-defined modern identity stack, creating massive opportunities for entrepreneurs and the investors that back them.",

He did not give a figure for the proposed public spending.\n\nMining in Peru is concentrated in the historically impoverished Andean region. Local communities there, many of them indigenous, have long complained they have failed to benefit from the mineral riches.\n\nLeftist President Pedro Castillo was elected last year with massive support in mining regions.\n\nMMG Ltd's Las Bambas copper mine suspended operations on April 20 after two local communities entered company property.

        title:
          "Gartner's Decision Intelligence Trend Is Taking Off. What Took So Long?",
        body: 'Decision intelligence has been a tech buzzword for several years. Still, it wasn\'t until last October that technology analyst firm Gartner named it a 2022 Top Trend and put a clear definition in place. By doing so, Gartner changed decision intelligence from a vague marketing term to an increasingly important business strategy.\n\nThe concept is grounded in the idea that companies should treat decision-making like other modern business processes and thus implement systems of record to model, track, learn from and improve specific management decisions. This decision-back approach starts with the critical decisions that drive company performance and then works back to the people, processes and insights needed to make consistent, high-quality decisions.\n\nWhile blessed with a catchy name, the decision intelligence category still took a while to coalesce. Until recently, leaders prioritized data and analytics investments over direct improvements to the decision-making process itself. As a result, the promise of "better decisions" was used for decades as a universal marketing backdrop for all technology solutions, especially data-centric solutions like business intelligence dashboards, analytics and artificial intelligence (AI). The theory was that business people would naturally make better decisions if companies invested in better data and analytics.\n\nTime and experience eroded that data-centric theory, revealing the reality that as much as 60% of such data investments are wasted. Decision-makers only use 22% of the jumble of data-driven insights they receive. The hype cycle for data, insights & analytics is maturing into the efficiency phase, bringing tough questions about how to optimize budgets and initiatives. At the same time, the sky-high AI promise of "soon you won\'t even need humans to make decisions" is falling back to earth. More and more executives are asking, "Will we ever see a concrete return on investment from all this data infrastructure?"\n\nThe emerging decision-back perspective is very different from past data-first strategies. Gartner\'s decision intelligence paradigm shift moves away from decisions as important but fuzzy marketing abstractions and towards decision-making as a concrete, measurable business process that needs to be managed. It changes decision intelligence from a clever rebranding of business intelligence and AI solutions to an entirely new transformation strategy.\n\nThe pandemic played a significant role in driving the decision intelligence tipping point. It is remarkably challenging to change decision-making behavior. However, the pandemic catalyzed decades of behavior change in months, tilling up old habits so that new ones could grow.\n\nFirst, the massive shift to remote online work broke many thought patterns about how collaboration, and thus decision-making, happens. Almost overnight, leaders learned how to operate and make decisions without being able to pull everyone into the same room.\n\nSecond, the massive overnight changes to business strategy and operations accelerated the already rapid pace of decision-making in modern businesses to truly overwhelming levels. This forced companies to learn to decentralize decision-making and push decisions out into the organization.\n\nMost importantly, companies learned that this new approach worked better than the old ways, driving sustained improvements in operating metrics and increases in stock prices after the initial lockdown disruptions.\n\nGeoffrey Moore\'s classic "crossing the chasm" framework for technology innovation emphasizes the difficulty of getting the first few pragmatic companies to implement new technology strategies. Such pragmatists are not enthusiastic about innovation in general. Instead, they have clearly defined needs that demand a technology solution. This chasm between enthusiastic early adopters and practical problem solvers played a significant role in holding back the decision intelligence trend.\n\nIn retrospect, it\'s not surprising that consumer packaged goods (CPG) and pharmaceutical industries have become the pragmatic beachhead for decision intelligence growth. In addition to pandemic-disrupted work practices, both industries were severely impacted by overnight transformations of consumer demands and widespread supply chain disruptions. As a result, these major global brands urgently need pragmatic solutions and are actively creating initiatives today.\n\nAs one example, my company works with a billion-dollar consumer goods company that has placed a moratorium on new data and analytics spending while implementing a decision intelligence strategy to optimize their investments to explicitly support and improve commercial decision-making. Theirs was not a small decision given the status quo, and more and more companies are making the same choice as awareness of decision intelligence grows.\n\nThese market changes have formed a new category of technology companies over the past several months. Besides my company, several other growing tech companies, including Peak, Sisu Data, Domo, Tellius, Diwo and others, are shifting their focus from data- and tech-centric business intelligence and artificial intelligence to business-centric decision intelligence solutions.\n\nYet all of these trends still miss the underlying explanation of why decision-making is both the essential business process and the last one to get a digital makeover: today, most decisions are fundamentally irrational, happening intuitively in shadows and sidebars. They have to be cornered before business leaders can conquer them one by one. Large companies have a history of pioneering disciplined business processes, giving them the scale and expertise to track decisions and bring this sort of rationality to a significant number of people. These global brands move very slowly until they move all at once.',

          "Gold Rises as Investors Seeking an Inflation Haven Pour Into Gold ETFs",
        body: "Gold didn't get the message that higher interest rates mean lower prices for the yellow metal.\n\nThe Federal Reserve raised rates by a widely expected 50 basis points (a half-percentage point) on Wednesday, signaling a series of rate hikes this year and a plan to reduce its balance sheet. Although gold slipped immediately after the Fed's move, prices resumed their climb on Thursday, and gold-market watchers say the metal still has more mettle in it.\n\nNormally, gold is less desirable to own when rates rise because it has no yield, making other yield-bearing havens like bonds more attractive. Yet there's a nuance to this narrative. What matters for gold are \"real\" interest rates -- those calculated by subtracting the inflation rate from the nominal rate. The federal-funds rate is now 0.75% to 1%, but the March consumer price index put inflation at 8.5%, so real rates remain well in negative territory.\n\nWill Rhind, chief executive of GraniteShares, issuer of the $1 billion GraniteShares Gold Trust exchange-traded fund (ticker: BAR), says that gold has an advantage over cash and bonds if nominal interest rates are positive but the real rates remain negative, since gold isn't losing value.\n\nJust as important as real interest rates is the trend and pace of the Fed's rate hikes. The gold market had priced in a 50-basis-point hike on Wednesday, Rhind says, which is why prices slipped modestly then and rebounded on Thursday. Gold actually made a new high for the week on Thursday, rising above $1,900 an ounce.\n\nRelated Market Data\n\nThat's still about $180 below February's all-time nominal high around $2,080, spurred by high inflation and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Since then, prices have deteriorated. They were about $1,850 as of Tuesday, as traders removed some of the war premium and in anticipation of the Fed's move.\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell signaled that \"50 basis-point increases should be on the table at the next couple of meetings\" of the Federal Open Market Committee, but that pace of increases isn't hawkish enough to pressure gold significantly, says Adrian Day, CEO of Adrian Day Asset Management, which specializes in resource investing. In his postmeeting press conference, Powell shot down the option for 75-basis-point hikes in the near term.\n\nBased on the central bank chief's post-FOMC comments, TD Securities expects that the Federal Reserve will continue to ratchet up rates until fed funds reach the 3% to 3.25% target range by March 2023. Even if nominal rates jump to about 3.25%, they'd still be significantly below the real rate, Day says.\n\n\"The most aggressive projections of Fed actions over the next 12 months will get the Fed to about 3.4%. Inflation is at 8.5%. At the end of this so-called hawkish Fed's first year of tightening...we will be more deeply negative in real terms than we were in 1975-76, at the beginning of the great inflation of the 1970s,\" Day says.\n\nInflation HavenInvestment flows from exchange-traded gold funds have played a key role in driving up gold prices.

Three-year returns are annualized. N/A=not applicable\n\nSource: Morningstar\n\nIn March, the Fed forecast that 2022 median core personal consumption expenditures -- its go-to inflation measure -- would be at 4.1% and saw the PCE in 2023 at 2.6%. The latest monthly core PCE reading in March was 5.2%.\n\n\"The Fed is thinking that inflation is going to be barely 4% by the end of the year. I think they're living in cloud-cuckoo land,\" Day observes.\n\nInvestment demand for gold might remain strong if real interest rates stay negative. That demand rose significantly in the first quarter of 2022, versus its level in the same period last year, according to the World Gold Council, an industry group.\n\nIn its first-quarter Gold Demand Trends publication, the group said that global investment demand, which includes that linked to ETFs, physical gold bars, and coins, rose 203% in the quarter, to 551 metric tons, versus 182 metric tons during the same period in 2021. The gain was led by ETF demand, up 269 metric tons versus an outflow in 2021's first quarter. This was the highest level of quarterly flows since 2020's third quarter.\n\nGold faces some headwinds in the near term, with the World Gold Council noting that the total supply jumped in the first quarter. Mine production rose 3%, year over year, to a record level, and supply-recycled gold, which is already-mined metal that's sold for scrap, increased 15%. Jewelry demand fell 7%, as consumers in China and India, the two top global purchasers of gold earrings, necklaces, and other baubles, acquired less. Central bank purchases were also muted in the quarter, down 29% versus the total a year earlier.\n\nBoth the slump in jewelry demand and increase in supply, especially scrap gold, are reactions to the first quarter's high prices, Rhind says. Persistent high prices could temper jewelry demand, but investment demand is the category to watch. Jewelry demand and mine supply tend to be correlated to global economic growth, but investment demand, particularly from ETFs, has more price impact than these other drivers, he adds.\n\nThe Fed's actions and their impact on real interest rates is the overarching influence on gold prices. But what's also critical are market perceptions of how well the Federal Reserve is balancing the battle against inflation and whether it's engineering a soft economic landing to avoid a recession. Rhind recalls that gold's 1970s inflation-induced parabolic rally took some time.\n\n\"It wasn't until the last couple of years that things started to get out of control. I think people felt like the central bank had lost control, and then the gold price really skyrocketed,\" he says.\n\nBoth Day and Rhind suggest that gold could return to its nominal all-time high, hit in February. Some forecasters look for the metal to reach $3,000 an ounce in two years. However, even that lofty price wouldn't top gold's January 1980 peak of $875, in inflation-adjusted terms. To do that, the metal would have to rise to a little over $3,200 an ounce, according to the CPI inflation calculator.\n\nEmail:",

          "Forbes EQ BrandVoice: Feeding Rural America One Community At A Time",
        body: "By: Essence Smith, Project Manager, Partners for Rural Transformation\n\nRural America grows a majority of this country's food. Paradoxically, these communities experience overwhelming levels of food insecurity and hunger. They are called food insecure, meaning they cannot consistently depend on affordable and nutritious foods to be available. Though the US' overall food insecurity rate was 10.9% in 2019, 12.5% of people in rural areas were food insecure, with 87% of the nation's food-insecure counties being rural (source: Feeding America). These areas are considered food deserts - areas with limited supplies of fresh, affordable foods. Millions of families and individuals live in these food deserts, having little to rely on other than convenience store foods for sustenance. Historical and ongoing institutionalized racism has resulted in egregious wealth disparities within persistent poverty counties throughout the United States, as rural communities of color are increasingly more likely to experience food insecurity over their white counterparts. Food insecurity has been linked to chronic disease and poor health, two issues that disproportionately affect persistent poverty in rural areas, specifically those with a majority of BIPOC residents.\n\nWhen comparing the country's poverty rate with the prevalence of food insecurity, the maps are nearly identical. Enter the Partners for Rural Transformation (PRT). Collectively, we create and support services addressing food provision and access for persistent poverty rural America. Please continue reading to see how PRT and our local constituents are curbing and ending food insecurity across persistent poverty rural America.\n\nIn 2020 cdcb | come dream. come build. (cdcb) started providing free food panties as a resource during the COVID-19 pandemic for the residents of Casitas Los Olmos in Raymondville TX, Casitas De Azucar in Santa Rosa, TX and La Hacienda Casitas in Harlingen, Tx. Although this effort started as a COVID relief effort, the food pantries are now a permanent resource that cdcb's resident services program offers. Nonperishable items are available the 1 week of the month until supplies last. The pantries benefit low to moderate-income Latinos in the rural areas of South Texas.\n\nNot to be outdone by bleak outlooks for the future, cdcb is also working to create a fully-functioning grocery store in downtown Brownsville, TX.\n\nAs with many other cities, Brownsville's downtown area has suffered from the economic downturn. A void was created by the exit of a long-standing healthy food source for the primarily low-income residents of downtown with the closure of the only grocery store in the neighborhood and the influx of dollar stores. The resultant food desert compounds the problem of obesity and diabetes. 80% of the region's population is overweight or obese, and almost 30% suffer from diabetes.\n\nTo reverse these trends and develop apt solutions, cdcb will redevelop the currently vacant Samano Securities Building to provide up to 15 new jobs, house 40 individuals, and be a site for the production and sale of healthy foods to the community.\n\nThe SAMANO is a holistic response to these and other issues negatively impacting historic downtown Brownsville: the lack of affordable housing for a growing homeless population, the lack of supportive services for the homeless population; the recent departure of a local grocery store creating a food desert; the continuing loss of historic buildings; and the lack of stable employment opportunities.\n\nSAMANO, when complete, will be made up of three separate businesses wholly owned by cdcb.\n\nThe CARES Act initially overlooked small-scale farmers. Communities Unlimited (CU) saw the need on both sides and developed the Farm to Food Pantry Project in 2020. The Mary Reynolds Babcock Foundation provided a $200,000 grant allowing Communities Unlimited to purchase produce from small-scale farmers in the Mississippi River Delta at fair market prices. CU bolstered the program by joining their existing Healthy Foods Program with the MRB Foundation, the Heartland Hands Food Pantry, and others to aid both the farmers and those facing hunger. All organizations working together purchased and distributed 80,000 pounds of fresh, locally grown produce from small-scale farmers and distributed in rural Mississippi and the Mississippi River Delta by the end of the growing season.\n\nThe second round of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) changed guidelines to impact those with the greatest need. The dedicated team at CU did the work with small-scale farmers, offering personal assistance rather than an impersonal online service. By providing support to the labor force, 15 farmers in the Mississippi River Delta received PPP loans and could keep their land and grow another season. Calvin Head, Director of Mileston Cooperative, a Black-owned cooperative in Tchula, MS., had a PPP loan advertised to them by another organization. The organization required the farmers to upload their documents to a portal, most of whom do not have computers or broadband. The farmers became frustrated and said, \"Forget about it.\" CU stepped in and offered an alternative. Eleven small-scale farmers in the Mississippi River Delta received PPP loans from Communities Unlimited. The funds those farmers received meant they could keep their land, plant, and grow for another season. They now continue to fill the gaps in a food system that has depended on transporting produce thousands of miles across the country or importing from other countries, creating jobs in communities where jobs were scarce.\n\nIn many of the 100+ Appalachian communities where Fahe Members serve, their organizations are the only providers of affordable housing, utility relief, affordable daycare for children and seniors, and access to affordable, healthy foods. Our Members are the quintessential \"jack of all trades\" for their communities. Fahe serves as a bridge to these organizations, connecting local needs with regional and national resources so that our members focus on what they do best -- helping vulnerable people. When it comes to addressing access to food, several Fahe Members serve their communities through food banks, summer feeding programs, and other initiatives like pay-what-you-can restaurants. For example, Fahe Member Christian Appalachian Project (CAP) organizes with more than 1,200 nonprofit organizations, community-based agencies, and churches to collect food, household supplies, and more for families. Operation Sharing has delivered more than $1.5 billion of donated materials to more than 1.5 million people over 30 years.\n\nOpen Door Café, operated by Fahe Member HOPE in Wytheville, VA, is Southwest Virginia's first donate-what-you-can community café, serving over 40,000 meals. It allows food-insecure individuals to eat by utilizing tokens purchased by other patrons through donations or volunteering an hour of their time through HOPE's volunteer programs. From January to March 2022, Open Door served 4,200 meals, received 1,450 volunteer hours from community members valued at $17,000 in-kind support, collected $7.8k in donations from patrons, and helped 83% of their patrons to receive meals for less than $8 per plate through tokens or other gift methods.\n\nUntil October 2021, grocery shopping was a painful and arduous experience for Amanda Griffin. She suffers joint and bone pain from Lupus and traveled 20 miles to the nearest supermarket, often relying on rides from neighbors. But now, she simply goes online, selects items she needs and has them delivered the same day.\n\nGriffin lives in Drew, Mississippi, population 1,927 and now the home of the Mississippi Delta Online Grocery Program. Working with HOPE, the Drew Collaborative, headed by Drew native Gloria Dickerson, has converted the former local armory into a distribution center for groceries and other staples. Residents of Drew order their groceries online and can pick them up at the armory or have them delivered by refrigerated van instead of driving 20 miles to the Walmart in Cleveland, Mississippi, the closest affordable full-service supermarket since Drew's last grocery store closed in 2014.\n\nWithout enough residents to make a grocery store sustainable, the town had been unable to attract an operator to open one. Shopping for food had cost residents gas or taxi money, eaten up their time, and left them without options to quickly re-stock perishable items. The Drew Collaborative contacted HOPE, which has a credit union branch in the town, for assistance in developing a method to bring convenient, healthy food options to the small town.\n\nTogether, the Drew Collaborative and HOPE formulated the concept for a local \"click and collect\" grocery shopping model and applied for grants to fund the project, with HOPE acting as the financial conduit. The grocery program opened in October 2021 and currently serves about 30 customers every month. Customers have access to a wide range of groceries, staples, and household items with the option to pay with a debit, credit, and/or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program cards.\n\nAs Native organizations, advocates, and leaders continue to build momentum towards Native sovereignty, Oweesta has seen how reviving and reclaiming educational, infrastructural, and ecological practices is needed for self-sufficiency. Native CDFIs consistently support the entrepreneurial leaders in the Native food sovereignty market. Oweesta is pleased to partner with the most prominent Native CDFI for agriculture: Akiptan.\n\nSouth Dakota-based Akiptan is single-handedly transforming Native agriculture and food supply chains through lending and one-on-one technical assistance. They have reached 19 Tribal Nations and committed over $10 million in loan capital. Their work has allowed producers to purchase land, livestock, equipment, infrastructure, and operating capital. Agriculture is an underutilized economic force in Indian Country, and Akiptan is working towards ending generational poverty and resource extraction with a patient, innovative capital.\n\nThe work of organizations like Akiptan is crucial. For thousands of years, Native Nations had mastery of their food systems. Through systemic land theft, forced displacements, and punitive federal policies, many Native Nations still experience food scarcity.\n\nMany Native organizations and entrepreneurs are reviving traditional food systems and leading a food renaissance. The reclamation is inherently tied to culture revitalization and resistance to forced social conditioning. We see the charge for change in the dynamic Landback movement, which calls for reconnection with the land. Tribes are taking back ownership of traditional foodways, and Native chefs and restaurant owners are inserting themselves into the mainstream foodie culture. Recently, First Nations Development Institute released a documentary on Netflix called Gather on the growing Native American food sovereignty movement. All these efforts are trying to rekindle the spirituality tied with the land and continue the practices and relationships as our ancestors did.",

          "Bitcoin Prices Keep Plunging and There's No Sign of Stopping. Where the Bottom May Be.",
        body: 'Cryptocurrency prices tumbled over the weekend and into Monday, with Bitcoin nearing a yearly low as investors continued to dump risky assets amid a tough stock market and challenging macroeconomic backdrop.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has fallen 4% over the past 24 hours to below $33,300, deepening losses from over the weekend after changing hands around $36,000 on Friday. It puts the largest crypto at its lowest level since January, and a move well below $33,000 would mark a new yearly bottom and the lowest level since July 2021.\n\nThe latest selloff brings Bitcoin to less than half the value of its all-time high of $68,990 reached in November 2021, and is a significant move away from the relatively tight range near $40,000 that Bitcoin has been trading around for months.\n\n"Bitcoin has followed the lead of the equity market, extending lower after a weak April," said Katie Stockton, managing partner at technical research group Fairlead Strategies.\n\n"Short-term momentum has deteriorated," Stockton said. "Bitcoin is no longer oversold from a short-term perspective. This creates additional risk."\n\nEther, the second-largest crypto, was down 5% to $2,400, declining over the weekend after trading around $2,700 on Friday. It\'s now changing hands around the lowest levels since mid-March.\n\nSmaller cryptos, or "altcoins," were unspared, declining Monday to further losses since Friday. Solana retreated 7% and Cardano was 9% in the red. Luna, the token that plays an integral role in maintaining stablecoin TerraUSD\'s peg to the U.S. dollar, has dropped 25% since Friday after selling pressure saw Terra de-peg over the weekend.\n\n"Memecoins" -- called that because they were initially intended as internet jokes rather than significant blockchain projects -- also fell, with Dogecoin losing 5% and Shiba Inu 11% lower.\n\nBitcoin and other digital assets should, in theory, trade independently of mainstream financial markets. But the recent selloff in cryptocurrencies largely matches action in the stock market, and Bitcoin has largely shown itself to be correlated with other risk-sensitive assets like stocks, and especially technology stocks.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index has lost more than 23% this year, putting it in bear market territory, while the wider S&P 500 is down 14%. The S&P 500 notched its fifth straight week of losses last Friday, the worst run since 2011, and on Monday.\n\nInvestors face a challenging and dynamic monetary policy environment. The Federal Reserve has already moved aggressively to raise interest rates this year, and is only expected to keep going as the central bank fights historically high inflation. This risks significantly denting economic demand, causing a recession.\n\nThe continuation of severe Covid-19 lockdowns in China, which threaten to compromise global supply chains, limiting companies\' access to materials and only stoking inflation further, only complicates matters.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, "risk assets" like tech stocks and cryptos are faring particularly badly as investor sentiment deteriorates, hurt in part because bond yields keep rising.\n\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note neared 3.2% on Monday, putting it on track to close at the highest levels since late 2018. When yields climb, the math is tough for riskier assets: Higher yields reduce the extra return relative to bonds that traders expect to get from taking riskier bets.\n\nSo where will cryptos find the bottom? In the near-term, volatility looks expected to continue, and a turnaround may not be coming any time soon.\n\n"Bitcoin may be on the course to restart a steep downtrend," said Yuya Hasegawa, an analyst at crypto exchange Bitbank, who sees the largest crypto trading in a range of $30,000 to $38,000 this week.\n\nLooming large in the days ahead is inflation data for April. The U.S. consumer price index (CPI) is due on Wednesday, and investors are likely to latch onto the number as the market keeps revising its estimates for how aggressive Fed policy will be.\n\nIf CPI grew more than 8.1% year over year last month, which is around what markets expect, investors could take that as a sign that the Fed will move more aggressively -- and this could lead to continued selling.\n\n"Although it will not be enough to reverse the market\'s sentiment completely, lower CPI readings will suffice to support the price of Bitcoin temporarily," said Hasegawa. "Until then, the price has to maintain the $33,000 psychological level, which is also around the 2022 low, to prevent the technical sentiment from aggravating further."\n\nAnother negative sign for the crypto market is that institutional money may be leading the price pressure, according to Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at digital asset broker GlobalBlock. Sotiriou said that, preceding the recent drop, the price for Bitcoin listed on exchange Coinbase Global (ticker: COIN) was at a discount compared to the Binance exchange.\n\n"This is telling as a greater percentage of institutions use Coinbase compared to retail, whereas the opposite is the case for Binance," Sotiriou said. "The price mismatch mentioned suggests institutions are not currently as interested as retail."\n\nWrite to Jack Denton at',

          "Challenging Business Environment Causes Fleets to Slow Adoption of Emerging Technologies",
        body: 'The latest Fleet Advisory Hub™ report shows fleet decision-makers are pausing strategic investments as they grapple with supply chain constraints and economic uncertainty\n\nEscalent - Fleet Advisory Hub - 2022 Fleet Technology Index\n\nLIVONIA, Mich., May 10, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- According to a new report from Escalent, a top human behavior and analytics advisory firm, the uncertainty of today\'s business climate has affected the strategic investment decisions of the country\'s commercial fleet owners and operators. From electrified and autonomous vehicles to telematics solutions and data analytics technologies, key fleet decision-makers are tempering their eagerness to adopt.\n\nThose are the latest findings from Fleet Advisory Hub™, a leading insights tool designed to explore the needs, expectations and emotions of commercial vehicle and fleet decision-makers. The platform, developed in 2019 by Escalent, offers an annual snapshot of the state of emerging technologies called the Fleet Technology Index (FTI). For each technology, the FTI provides an analytically based sense of market readiness and expectation for adoption, taking into consideration the perceptions of the current business environment and several predictive factors.\n\nThe FTI measured the state of adoption for eight key technologies in 2021: data analytics, telematics, battery electric vehicles (BEVs), autonomous vehicles (AVs), artificial intelligence, drones, mobility service and blockchain. Survey respondents showed less eagerness to adopt each of these key technologies, with data analytics, battery electric vehicles and artificial intelligence showing the biggest drops in their year-over-year FTI score.\n\n"Commercial fleets are among the businesses most impacted by the supply chain disruptions we\'ve witnessed over the past 18 months," said Lucas Lowden, insights consultant and program lead of Fleet Advisory Hub at Escalent. "Naturally, fleet owners and operators are evaluating how best to preserve the strength of their businesses today while exploring ways to incorporate new, game-changing technologies that will serve them in the long run."\n\nDespite the decrease in FTI scores across the board compared with 2020, each technology posted a higher number than in 2019 -- notably, prior to the pandemic -- demonstrating their relative resilience and likelihood of eventual adoption.\n\n"While fleet operators are pumping the brakes on ramping up adoption in the very near term, expectations remain that implementation of these technologies is a matter of when, not if," added Lowden.\n\nFleet Advisory Hub is one of the largest collections of commercial vehicle and fleet decision-maker insights available on the market today. Currently, nearly 10,000 fleets collectively numbering over 800,000 vehicles are represented.\n\nAbout Fleet Advisory Hub™\n\nThe results reported come from our 2022 FTI report about the current state of market readiness for adoption of emerging technologies by commercial vehicle and fleet businesses and comprise a subset of commercial and fleet vehicle decision-makers drawn from the Fleet Advisory Hub audience. Participants were recruited from an opt-in online panel of business decision-makers and interviewed online. Escalent will supply the exact wording of any survey question upon request.\n\nAbout Escalent\n\nEscalent is an award-winning advisory firm that helps clients understand human and market behaviors to navigate disruption and business transformation.

          "Slack's former head of machine learning wants to put AI in reach of every company",
        body: 'Adam Oliner, co-founder and CEO of Graft used to run machine learning at Slack, where he helped build the company\'s internal artificial intelligence infrastructure. Slack lacked the resources of a company like Meta or Google, but it still had tons of data to sift through and it was his job to build something on a smaller scale to help put AI to work on the data set.\n\nWith a small team, he could only build what he called a "miniature" solution in comparison to the web scale counterparts. After he and his team built it, however, he realized that it was broadly applicable and could help other smaller organizations tap into AI and machine learning without huge resources.\n\n"We built a sort of mini Graft at Slack for driving semantic search and recommendations throughout the product. And it was hugely effective...And that was when we said, this is so useful, and so powerful if we can get this into the hands of most organizations, we think we could really change the way people interact with their data and interact with AI," Oliner told me.\n\nLast year he decided to leave Slack and go out on his own and started Graft to solve the problem for many companies. He says the beauty of the solution is that it provides everything you need to get started. It\'s not a slice of a solution or one that requires plug-ins to complete. He says it works for companies right out of the box.\n\n"The point of Graft is to make the AI of the 1% accessible to the 99%." he said. What he means by that is giving smaller companies the ability to access and put to use modern AI, and in particular pre-trained models for certain specific tasks, something he says offers a tremendous advantage.\n\n"These are sometimes called trunk models or foundation models, a term that a group at Stanford is trying to coin. These are essentially very large pre-trained models that encode a lot of semantic and structural knowledge about a domain of data. And this is useful because you don\'t have to start from scratch on every new problem," he said.\n\nThe company is still a work in progress, working with beta customers to refine the solution, but expects to launch a product later this year. For now they have a team of 11 people, and Oliner says that it\'s never too early to think about building a diverse team.\n\nWhen he decided to start the company, the first person he sought out was Maria Kazandjieva, former head of engineering at Netflix. "I have been working at building the rest of the founding team and also hiring others with an eye toward diversity and inclusion. So, you know, just [the other day], we were talking with recruiting communities that are focused on women and people of color, partly because we feel like investments now in building diverse team will just make it so much easier later on," he said.\n\nAs the journey begins for Graft, the company announced what it is calling a pre-seed investment of $4.5 million led by GV with help from NEA, Essence VC, Formulate Ventures and SV Angel.',

        title: "Bets Increase on Euro Slide to Parity With Dollar",
        body: "Options show the odds of parity in next year are a coin tossFunds bet more than $4 billion in notional value on parity\n\nHedge funds are increasingly betting on a slide in the euro to parity with the dollar for the first time in two decades.\n\nIt's the most popular wager in the options market among bets on a further drop in the common currency. Options pricing shows the odds of the milestone being hit in the next 12 months have risen to about 50%, a coin toss.\n\nThat's drawn more than $4 billion in notional value staked on $1.00 since the European Central Bank's last meeting on April 14, according to data from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation. Traders are betting against the consensus of analysts, who see the euro recovering to $1.11 by year-end. Yet with the currency already down 7% this year to about $1.05, more banks are also hedging their forecasts.\n\n\"The euro is a pro-cyclical currency, and the cycle doesn't look good,\" said ING Groep NV strategists including Chris Turner. \"We cannot rule out euro-dollar at parity this year.\"\n\nCitigroup Inc. strategists including Adam Pickett recently recommended three-month put options on euro parity to clients, while RBC Capital Markets last week revised its year-end euro call to $1.00.\n\nThe euro has been battered by the region's proximity to the Ukraine war, which has simultaneously fanned price pressures while denting the economic growth outlook. That's left the currency suffering even as ECB policy makers signal the need for the first rate hikes in a decade.\n\nWith funds adding euro downside exposure in options, that's left dealers in a so-called short-gamma position, which can amplify volatility. That means if the euro hits fresh lows, currency desks will have to sell into weakness to hedge their position, only bringing parity closer.\n\nThe common currency could still get propped up by further verbal intervention by ECB officials. That could result in hedge funds trimming their short option bets and thus balance out market makers' exposure. Still, that's not swaying the euro's naysayers.\n\n\"We started the year in the bearish euro-dollar minority and stayed there, even as the ECB started turning hawkish, but like many we've been surprised by the speed of the move,\" said Elsa Lignos, global head of foreign-exchange strategy at RBC Capital Markets. \"We expect a 2-3% yield differential between the euro zone and U.S. to push euro-dollar to an eventual test of parity.\"",

          "Here's a list of 50 companies that are well-armed to beat back inflation",
        body: "Another turnaround Tuesday may be in the cards after a litany of concerns including stagflation dragged the S&P 500 SPX, +1.47% below 4,000 for the first time since 2021.\n\nAs investors try to regroup from , one more hard day of selling for the S&P might be a good thing, maintains JonesTrading's chief strategist Michael O'Rourke.\n\nA push into \"bear market territory\" -- commonly defined as a 20% drop from recent highs -- would set the S&P up for a technical bounce ahead of Wednesday's CPI numbers, he tells clients. Data showing that the March print of 8.5% was an inflationary peak -- 8.1% is expected -- should give a \"psychological boost to equities\" O'Rourke adds.\n\nOnto our call of the day from AllianceBernstein analysts, who say the key to downside protection in a market facing persistent and higher inflation is \"owning names that have pricing power.\" Heading into the second half of 2022, they offer an update on what's been a in the past year or so and a fresh list of companies that fit the bill.\n\n\"We use gross margin to define pricing power because a company's ability to enhance revenues in the face of rising costs, helps us determine which firms will be able to effectively pass increasing expenses onto consumers,\" writes a team of Bernstein analysts led by Ann Larson.\n\nThe Bernstein Pricing Power Indicator ranks companies by their ability to manage or improve gross margins. Thrown into the calculations are the last two years of growth in gross margins, along with the past seven years of gross margin stability. Those metrics are standardized across industries for a final pricing power score, with return on equity instead of gross margin used for financials.\n\n\"Using this methodology, we found that during U.S. inflationary periods, stocks in the highest quintile of our Pricing Power Indicator consistently outperformed those in the lowest quintile. On average the outperformance was ~ 430 bps a year,\" said Larson and the team.\n\nHere's another chart laying that out:\n\nAdmittedly, they say this hasn't been a completely smooth strategy. High pricing power stocks rebounded in the last three quarters of 2021, after underperforming in the second half of 2020 and first quarter of 2021. Year-to-date returns \"have been inconsistent amid the large factor rotations and volatility we've seen so far this year,\" says Bernstein.\n\nSo here's their list of U.S. stocks with market values greater than $5 billion in the highest quintile of pricing power and in the top two quintiles of positive sales revisions.

        body: "Ten times.\n\nThat's how often I've seen these market slumps, tumbles and crashes during the 25 years I've been writing about this stuff. At least.\n\nThis includes slumps in 2010 and 2011 that were as bad as this one, and which I bet you've totally forgotten about even if you lived through them. But it also includes the memorable dramas of 2000-3 and 2007-9, when share prices halved, and March 2020, when they fell by a third in a few weeks.\n\nIf you were underinvested in stocks when the market was falling you felt smug about it, as you probably do now.\n\nIf you were still underinvested coming out...not so much.\n\nAfter all of these crashes came and went, $1 invested 25 years ago in a broad stock market fund like the Vanguard Total Stock Market Fund VTSMX, -3.49% would be worth $8.30 today. The bears lost.\n\nWith markets starting their sixth week in the red, it raises a couple of urgent questions. One is unanswerable: How low are we going to go? Nobody knows. Flip a coin. Take a guess. Go to Their guess will be as good as anyone else's.\n\nAnother question is more useful and probably easier to answer: If we're long-term investors, what should we be buying?\n\nA number of market strategists say that at this point there is one area of the market that is looking particularly cheap, especially in relation to everything else. That area isn't the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.58% of large-company stocks, the usual go-to for 401(k) and IRA investors. It's small-company stocks. Especially boring, higher-quality, so-called \"value\" small companies.\n\nThe broad Russell 2000 small cap index RUT, +1.28% has already plunged 25% since its peak last November. This is one of the sharpest, biggest falls on record. This index, the general benchmark for smaller U.S. companies, is now lower than it was when Joe Biden became president 16 months ago.\n\nAnd it's left them cheap. \"Small-caps are [in] the bottom 3% of their historical 'relative' valuation range versus the S&P 500, and small cap value stocks are in the first percentile,\" Doug Ramsey, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group, tells me.\n\n\"On a price-to-earnings (PE) basis small-cap stocks remain 'on sale' in relation to large cap,\" Will Nasgovitz, portfolio manager of Heartland Value Fund, a value-oriented stock fund. \"This is only the third time in the last 42 years small-caps have sold at this large of a discount.\" Within small-caps, he adds, \"value seems to be at a decided advantage over small-cap growth.\"\n\nNasgovitz, reached at his Milwaukee, Wis. offices, says that he typically follows the narrower S&P 600 small cap index SML, +0.42% rather than the Russell 2000. (The S&P index excludes many riskier or more speculative companies.)\n\nHe says that at the moment the S&P 600 trades at less than 12 times forecast earnings for the next 12 months, compared to nearly 18 times for the S&P 500. That discount is very big by historical measures, he points out.\n\nI've run a longer-term chart, showing the Russell 2000 index in relation to the S&P 500 going back to 1987. This is a comparative chart, showing one divided by the other. As you can see, over the long term they have tended in the same direction, but at different points in time one was more in fashion than the other. The smart play seemed to be to bet on whichever was cheaper.\n\nEven if small-caps are an opportunity, they are not a freebie. Small-cap stocks are usually more volatile than large-company stocks (though not always). Leuthold's Ramsey warns that even though small-caps are cheaper today, that probably won't help you in the short term.\n\n\"The history of small-caps is that they will fully participate in an equity bear market regardless of their comparative valuations,\" Ramsey says. He adds: \"I do believe, though, that they will greatly outperform the S&P 500 over the next 3-5 years.\"\n\nThere are multiple ways of dipping your toe in the small-caps pond. They include through an actively managed fund such as Heartland Value HRTVX, -2.97% (It has fees of 1.1% a year, and has outperformed the Russell 2000 Value index over 1 and 5 years, though not over 10.) Or through a low-cost passive fund that doesn't try to pick winners. Among low-cost exchange-traded funds, the Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF VTWO, +0.57% has fees of just 0.1%. The SPDR S&P 600 Small Cap ETF SPSM, +0.01%, which follows the narrower, higher-quality index, has fees of 0.05%. The value-oriented equivalent, the SPDR S&P 600 Value ETF SLYV, -0.13%, charges 0.15%.\n\nAn published seven years ago by hedge fund company AQR argued that if small-caps have done better over time than large-caps, that outperformance has been concentrated among better quality stocks. If they're right, it's a case for preferring the better quality S&P 600 index over the broader, less discriminating Russell.\n\nWall Street number crunchers continue to debate whether there is a so-called \"small-cap effect,\" meaning whether small-caps over time have outperformed large-caps. But the advantage of the current situation is that you don't need to care. So long as the long-term performance is at least in line with large-caps, the current discount offers an opportunity.",

          "Bitcoin Is Proving It Isn't Gold 2.0 as It's Moving in Same Direction as Stocks",
        body: "After a stormy week for markets, stock market futures are pointing down again Monday.\n\nConcerns that aggressive interest-rate increases, geopolitical tensions from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and another Covid-induced economic slump in China have already pulled the Nasdaq into a . Inflation data due out Wednesday may further stoke fears that the Federal Reserve will take no prisoners in its quest to keep consumer prices in check.\n\nFor its part, Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, is worth at around $34,000. It has lost a quarter of its value this year, compared with a 22% drop in the Nasdaq and a 13% decline in the S&P 500.\n\nIt isn't an easy time to , but surely it is good news for crypto that it continues to trade more or less like risky stocks. Sure, Bitcoin is proving that it isn't a haven asset like gold when inflation is quickening. But it also isn't a meme stock that is wildly disconnected from everything else.\n\nIt is important to keep an eye on that if things get worse from here. Companies, at least, offer future revenues as a basis for their values. Bonds have yields. It is still not widely accepted what benefit cryptocurrencies offer, as Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett recently . The investment case is largely based on the idea that value will go up in future.\n\nAt the moment, that proposition is looking harder to justify.\n\n-- Brian Swint\n\n*** Join Barron's senior managing editor Lauren R. Rublin today at noon as she chats with deputy editor Ben Levisohn and Charles Lemonides, founder of ValueWorks, about the outlook for financial markets, industry sectors, and individual stocks.\n\n***Bitcoin Near Half Its Peak as Investors Sidestep Risk\n\nThe price of Bitcoin fell below $34,000 over the weekend but recovered some ground to $35,197 on Sunday evening. It is now nearly half its all-time high. The cryptocurrency's fall over the weekend echoed the broader stock market's decline last week as investors stepped away from riskier assets.\n\nBitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, hit a peak price of $67,802.30 a coin in November 2021. The price of Ether, the second-largest digital asset, dropped 0.2% to $2,533 on Sunday. \"Risk assets\" such as tech stocks and cryptos have been hurt because bond yields keep rising. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury was 3.14% Sunday evening. Higher Treasury yields reduce the extra return relative to bonds that traders expect from taking riskier bets. Last week, software company MicroStrategy's chief financial officer, Phong Le, said it would face a margin call if Bitcoin's price drops to $21,000, reported. MicroStrategy owned $5.9 billion of Bitcoin at the end of March, after taking out a $205 million Bitcoin-collateralized loan with Silvergate Bank to buy more Bitcoin.\n\nWhat's Next: MicroStrategy shares are down 62% since Bitcoin's November peak, and down 46% this year. Le said the company could contribute more Bitcoin to the collateral package, so \"we don't ever get into a situation of a margin call.\"\n\n-- Janet H. Cho\n\n***G-7 Nations Vow to Phase Out Russian Energy\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday joined a virtual meeting of the Group of Seven, including the U.K., Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, and the U.S., to phase out dependence on and imports of Russian energy and help nations to find alternative energy sources.\n\nIn separate visits to Ukraine, first lady Jill Biden met on Mother's Day with first lady Olena Zelenska and praised \"all of the brave and resilient mothers of Ukraine.\" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reopened his country's embassy in Kyiv, and tweeted that Canada is suspending tariffs on Ukrainian imports. A Russian airstrike in eastern Ukraine killed 60 villagers who were hiding in a school, and Ukrainian forces in Mariupol vowed to fight until the end. Ukrainian Ambassador Oksana Markarova told CBS that Russians killed more Mariupol civilians in two months than the Nazis killed in two years. The U.S. announced fresh sanctions against Russia, including cutting off Western advertising from Russia's three state-owned television stations, prohibiting U.S. accounting and consulting firms from advising Russians, and banning equipment that could help Russia's military. Russian President Vladimir Putin aims to send a \"doomsday\" warning to the West during Russia's Victory Day celebration today, including a flyover by supersonic fighters, Tu-160 strategic bombers, and the II-80 \"doomsday\" command that would carry Russia's top brass in a nuclear war, reported.\n\nWhat's Next: The U.S. also 27 executives from Gazprombank, which oversees Russia's sales of natural gas, and eight from Sberbank, and imposed 2,600 visa restrictions on Russian and Belarussian officials who supported or enabled the war in Ukraine.\n\n-- Janet H. Cho\n\n***Disney's 'Doctor Strange' Notches Biggest 2022 Debut Weekend\n\nWalt Disney Co.'s Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness took in on its theatrical debut weekend in the U.S. and Canada, more than double the 2016 opening of the first movie in the series and the biggest opening weekend for a movie so far this year.\n\nThe opening comes in ahead of The Batman's $134 million weekend in March. Internationally, the latest Doctor Strange installment made an estimated $265 million since opening Wednesday, bringing total receipts to $450 million. IMAX and 3-D screens were 36% of Doctor Strange's total box office. The Marvel production, in which Doctor Strange battles the forces of evil in parallel universes, is just the start to summer blockbuster season, including the coming releases of the next Downton Abbey film, plus Top Gun: Maverick, Jurassic World Dominion, and Bullet Train. Disney shares reached a 52-week low on Friday, down nearly 29% this year, as the Hollywood studio, theme-park operator and media streaming company grapples with an uneven reopening. It is also at odds with the state of Florida over the loss of its special tax status after criticizing a new sex education law.\n\nWhat's Next: Disney is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Analysts tracked by FactSet expect it to report earnings per share of $1.19 on revenue of $20 billion, which would be down 7% from the first quarter.\n\n-- Liz Moyer\n\n***Wall Street Awaits a Sign That Inflation Has Peaked\n\nWall Street is looking for signs that inflation has peaked, though many economists and the Federal Reserve itself believe inflation will remain higher for longer than they thought it would six months ago. Unknowns include effects of the lingering and the Russia-Ukraine war's influence on commodity prices.\n\nThe dollar is near a two-decade high against other currencies despite inflation at its highest in 40 years. The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the currency against a basket of others, is up 8% this year, while the euro, British pound, and Japanese yen are lower. Economic weakness worldwide is driving the dollar's climb, with lockdowns in China slowing industrial production there and Russia's war spiking energy prices for European households. The eurozone's economy faces the threat of a recession, reported. A strong dollar means Americans can buy things from other countries at a lower price, but it can also make U.S. products more expensive for foreigners. Microsoft said the strong dollar cut its revenue last quarter, the Journal reported. U.S. consumers have more money in their bank accounts and continue to spend despite rising prices. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the economy can weather a series of interest-rate increases.\n\nWhat's Next: The Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the consumer price index for April on Wednesday. Analysts expect a gain of 8.1% over last year, or 5.9% excluding volatile food and energy prices. The March readings rose 8.5% and 6.5% respectively.\n\n-- Liz Moyer\n\n***Infineon Raises Outlook on Strong Semiconductor Demand\n\nInfineon Technologies, Europe's largest chip maker, posted strong lifting its full-year guidance, as demand for semiconductors remained high in a global shortage. This comes just days after an earnings and revenue beat from rival Advanced Micro Devices, which is taking share from Intel.\n\nThe Frankfurt-listed company's profit rose to €469 million ($493 million), or €0.36 per share in the three months to Mar. 31, from €203 million, or €0.15 for the same period a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share were €0.44, compared with €0.24 per share. Infineon lifted its outlook for 2022 by €500 million to around €13.5 billion, including a range of plus or minus €500 million. The company had previously forecast full-year revenue of €13 billion, plus or minus €500 million. CEO Jochen Hanebeck warned that uncertainties, in particular the Russia-Ukraine war and Covid-19, are placing stress on supply chains, but demand for products \"continues to exceed supply significantly.\"\n\nWhat's Next: There is nothing to suggest the uncertainties surrounding the supply-chain issues, affecting much of the sector, will abate soon. But while Infineon was upbeat on demand, last month Intel flagged a of personal computers. Inflation and the cost of living crisis will only likely add to that weaker demand.\n\n-- Lina Saigol and Rupert Steiner\n\n*** MarketWatch Wants to Hear From You\n\nI'm newly self-employed.

        title: "Investors are Bearish on These 10 Stocks Today",
        body: "In this article, we will discuss some of the popular stocks losing on Monday. To take a look at some more stocks that are in the news, go to Investors are Bearish on These 5 Stocks Today.\n\nThe US stocks have fallen to their lowest level since the start of the year as the S&P 500 Index has dropped 2.34% as of 11:59 AM ET to a YTD low of just over 4,000. The market is under pressure after closing in the red for the past five consecutive weeks. Moreover, The NASDAQ Composite Index has declined 3.11%, and the Dow 30 Index has plummeted 1.52% as of 11:59 AM ET. Popular companies that investors are bearish on today include Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN), and Twitter, Inc. (NASDAQ:TWTR).\n\nCopyright: wolandmaster / 123RF Stock Photo\n\nLet's look at why these stocks are losing today and discuss how hedge funds are positioned in them.\n\n10. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has declined 1.86% as of 11:56 AM ET after reports that the Santa Clara, California-based company is facing delays in launching its much anticipated Arc Alchemist series of graphic cards. Initially, the graphic card series launch was expected to take place last year, but Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) delayed it to Q2 2022. Now, there are reports that the launch is likely to take place between the start of July and the end of August. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) shared that the delay in launch is due to software issues.\n\nOut of the 72 hedge funds holding a stake in Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Seth Klarman's Baupost Group was the leading hedge fund investor in the company as of Q4 2021.\n\n9. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is 6.01% in the red as of 11:56 AM ET after the shares of the Austin, Texas-based electric vehicle company came under pressure due to investors' concerns regarding the macroeconomic outlook and lockdowns in China. Furthermore, Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess said that his company would not give up on its mission of overtaking Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) to become the biggest seller of electric vehicles globally by 2025. Diess stated that Volkswagen's diversified product offering comprising mass-market to luxury and premium EVs would aid in surpassing Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) as the market leader.\n\nAs of Q4 2021, 91 hedge funds held a stake in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\n8. Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) has lost 21.02% of its value as of 11:49 AM ET after the Colorado-based software company specializing in big data analytics reported a slowdown in sales growth. Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) has been scaling its salesforce to expand its footprint in the middle of intense competition. The company highlighted that the recent conflict between Russia and Ukraine could provide a \"wide range\" of potential upside to its estimates due to more opportunities to render services to the US army and the CIA. However, Palantir Technologies Inc.'s (NYSE:PLTR) first-quarter results did not reflect any impact of this potential upside.\n\nOut of the 924 hedge funds covered by Insider Monkey, 33 funds held a stake in Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) as of Q4 2021.\n\n7. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is down 6.95% as of 11:56 AM ET. High-flying tech stocks are taking a hit due to a broad market sell-off. Shareholders are taking a cautious approach by liquidating their holdings and looking toward economic data and corporate earnings to understand the strength of the economy better. Investors are facing uncertainty from all fronts as the Federal Reserve increased the benchmark rates last week to combat inflation. Moreover, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine has created geopolitical tensions, contributing to a fear of recession. Such circumstances have created an adverse environment for tech companies such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to achieve their growth objectives.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was held by 69 hedge funds as of Q4 2021. Fisher Asset Management is the leading investor in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) as of Q1 2022.\n\n6. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) has plummeted 6.81% as of 11:57 AM ET after a letter from CEO Dara Khosrowshahi revealed that the San Francisco, California-based ride-hailing corporation intends to cut down its marketing expense and slow down new hiring. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) shared that the company's driver pool is currently at its highest level since the start of the pandemic. The company intends to achieve break-even status on a free cash flow basis as opposed to the prior target of achieving breakeven at an adjusted EBITDA level.\n\nOf the 924 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) was held by 153 hedge funds as of Q4 2021.\n\nAlong with Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), some other notable stocks that are declining today include Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN), and Twitter, Inc. (NASDAQ:TWTR).",

        title: "Here's everything you'll see at TechCrunch Mobility next week",
        body: "TC Sessions: Mobility is back, and this year we are bringing together the best and brightest founders, investors, engineers and experts on the future of transportation for a two-day, in-person event May 18 and May 19 in San Mateo, California.\n\nAn online day will follow on May 20 to give our audience, including those who were unable to attend, a chance to tune in and catch highlights from the live event, network and watch the full sessions. We're excited to announce VW Group CEO Herbert Diess will discuss his vision for the future of mobility during this online-only portion of the event.\n\nTC Sessions: Mobility will feature speakers on the main stage, a bevy of startup exhibits, demos, networking and a live pitch-off with a pretty sweet prize. We're excited to give a first look at some of the folks -- and vehicles -- who will be on our main stage and what we plan to talk about.\n\nWho will be on our stage? We're glad you're asked. Let's start with two vehicles that haven't had an in-person public debut yet: an electric vehicle that Arrival is building for Uber and the custom-built Zoox robotaxi.\n\nOther topics on our list for this year include exploring the opportunities and challenges for urban air companies and cities, the dual paths companies are taking to commercialize autonomous vehicle technology, cybersecurity, micromobility, self-driving trucks and autonomous delivery. New to the agenda, we're thrilled to add legendary design chief Ralph Gilles of the newly-formed conglomerate, Stellantis.\n\nOur guests include Aurora co-founder and chief product officer Sterling Anderson, Motional CTO Laura Major, Nuro co-founder and CEO Jiajun Zhu and Waymo co-CEO Dmitri Dolgov. Then there's Bonny Simi, who heads up air operations and people at Joby Aviation, and Rebecca Yeung, corporate vice president at FedEx, who is responsible for the company's robotics and autonomous vehicle initiatives, as well as cybersecurity phenoms Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek with Cruise.\n\nBuy your general admission, student or early-stage startup demo package today before prices increase in a few days. We've also recently added two new ways to attend the event; Expo Only and Online Only (May 20) passes ($75 and $45, respectively).\n\nMay 18\n\nAutonomous vehicle technology has evolved from the confines of academic research to living labs -- aka testing on closed tracks and public roads. Now, a handful of companies, including Cruise and Motional, are trying to turn their innovations into a product that not only has the technical capability to navigate city streets, but is approachable and easy for people to use. Cruise VP of product and former Voyage co-founder Oliver Cameron and Motional CTO Laura Major will cover the technical and deployment challenges to creating a product people can and will want to use.\n\nNext year top automakers will sell luxury consumer vehicles that include safe, hands-free driving features. LiDAR will take these automated driving systems to the next level, and re-establish trust with consumers who stand to benefit from these life-saving technologies. Innoviz Technologies CEO and Co-founder Omer Keilaf will discuss the long road to making automotive-grade LiDAR, in order to help car makers like BMW achieve Level 3 automation for the first time. What's next? The tech is ready. Now it's time to integrate it into cars around the world and properly educate consumers so they love, not loathe, automated driving again.\n\nZoox first debuted its custom-built robotaxi vehicle in December 2020 in a virtual event. That vehicle has been largely under wraps ever since, with testing occurring in areas away from the public. Now, the Zoox vehicle is ready for an up-close and personal debut at TC Sessions: Mobility. Zoox co-founder and CTO Jesse Levinson will discuss the vehicle, the company's progress and where we might see Zoox next.\n\nNuro is aiming to revolutionize delivery with the autonomous vehicle technology it has developed, tested and is now beginning to deploy. The company has managed to lock up numerous high-profile partnerships in the process, including with Domino's and Walmart, not to mention a long list of investors. We'll sit down with Nuro co-founder and CEO Jiajun Zhu to talk about the company's path to commercialization, the opportunities and challenges of AV delivery and where the industry -- and Nuro -- is headed.\n\nWaymo, Alphabet's self-driving arm, has reached significant milestones recently, from launching a robotaxi service in San Francisco to securing partnerships with legacy logistics companies that will help it commercialize autonomous freight. However, challenges remain on all sides -- political, technological, commercial and social. Dmitri Dolgov, co-CEO of Waymo, was there from the beginning. As one of the founders of Google's self-driving car project, which began in 2009 and became Waymo in 2016, he'll talk us through how far autonomy has come, and how far it still has to go.\n\nSpoiler alert: Uber for X is no longer a differentiator. Mobility isn't a nascent vertical, and sector startups seeking funding should consider that advantage. Investors don't need to explain the venture-sized opportunity in the transportation industry; instead they want to see contrarian growth -- whether that's a new angle on an old technology, or profitability. TechCrunch is bringing together three venture capitalists -- Yoon Choi from Muirwoods Ventures, Mar Hershenson from Pear VC and Gabriel Scheer from Elemental -- to talk about their investment strategies, what's hot and what's not.\n\nThe industry's brightest entrepreneurs will take the stage in front of a live audience and a panel of industry experts, pitching revolutionary technologies.\n\nDespite the vast sums of venture capital that has gone into shared micromobility, the industry has yet to reach unit economics favorable enough to turn a profit. But it's getting close. We'll sit down with Drover AI's Alex Nesic, Acton's Janelle Wang and one other panelist to talk about the new methods, and the new tech, that's being deployed to help micromobility companies unlock profits.\n\nWhat will it take to execute urban air mobility operations in cities? TechCrunch Mobility will sit down with Gary Gysin, president and CEO of Wisk Aero, Cyrus Sigari, co-founder and managing partner at UP.Partners, and Bonny Simi, head of air operations and people at Joby Aviation, to discuss both the challenges and opportunities in urban air mobility and the ecosystem that will need to be created to support it and what it will take to not just launch in cities, but to actually be of value to residents.\n\nAurora has been running a pilot program with FedEx to haul goods between Dallas and Houston via self-driving Paccar trucks since September 2021. As with most other autonomous freight pilots, human safety operators are present in the vehicles, but Aurora's goal is to operate its trucks fully autonomously by the end of next year. We'll check in with Aurora co-founder Sterling Anderson and FedEx's head of robotics and autonomous vehicle technology Rebecca Yeung, and discuss the pilot's progress and implications for the future of autonomous trucking.\n\nAs autonomous vehicles creep towards commercialization, a question has started to loom for city planners, urban dwellers and even the companies trying to develop the technology. What does an equitable, accessible and safe AV look and act like? In other words, what is a good AV citizen? Summer Fowler, chief corporate responsibility officer at Argo AI, Riccardo Giraldi, senior director of experience at Zoox and Alisyn Malek, executive director of the Coalition for Reimagined Mobility will discuss how to build an AV for everyone, including the cyclists, pedestrians and human drivers who will share the road with them.\n\nBreakout Session brought to you by Pony.ai\n\nAt Pony.ai, we aim to deliver autonomous mobility everywhere by building safe and reliable autonomous driving technology. Since our founding in 2016 in Fremont, California, we have been pioneering autonomous mobility services that benefit global users in five cities across the U.S. and China. With 6.2 million autonomous miles driven, Pony.ai's core autonomous driving technology enables the \"virtual driver\" to navigate diverse traffic scenarios and inclement weather smoothly and safely.\n\nBreakout Session brought to you by Appen\n\nAppen is the Data for AI Lifecycle leader. This session will explore use cases and challenges that our clients see from data sourcing, data preparation and model evaluation by humans. Our experts will discuss and demo the technologies and processes that were used to enable success for both in-cabin experiences and out-of-car data with ADAS systems and autonomous vehicles.\n\nBreakout Session brought to you by GPR\n\nAutomakers and AV companies use GPR's subterranean mapping and localization platform to deliver a safe automated driving experience without relying on clear lane markings, cooperative weather and lighting, or stable visual landmarks. GPR is expanding where and when consumer vehicles with automated features and AVs can operate, opening new markets and bringing a level of autonomy that can earn the public's trust. GPR CEO Tarik Bolat will detail how GPR's product works, how automakers and AV companies are using it today and what it means for the future of high-volume passenger vehicle autonomy, robotaxis and automated freight.\n\nWith transportation accounting for the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, there are few business decisions that could make as much of an impact on greenhouse gas emissions as electrifying transportation, particularly mass transit. But for sustainability at this scale, businesses must consider an ecosystem approach to thrive. Drawing from Zum's expertise in leading the charge to transition school bus fleets to EV, this roundtable will focus on the creative and innovative ways business leaders, investors, professionals and the community at large can work together to achieve a greener future.\n\nMany believe self-flying planes will begin transporting passengers in our lifetime. Do you see yourself as an early adopter of autonomous flight? Join Maxime Gariel, CTO of Xwing, the company leading autonomous aviation, in an engaging discussion where we will explore what it would be like to take your first autonomous flight. Maxime can also share insights to the common misconceptions of autonomous flight, how the technology is currently impacting the aviation market and how close we truly are to commercial autonomous flight.\n\nVehicles have long been defined by the hardware that powers them, but cutting-edge technologies are carrying mobility into a software-first future. Vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) have upwards of 100 computers known as electronic control units (ECUs) operating largely independently from one another. But the transition to connected, autonomous, shared, electric vehicles consolidates that into a small number of powerful computers. This means the computer architecture becomes simpler while the software becomes more complex, which requires a more robust level of software integration than ever before. This is creating hurdles that must be overcome for traditional original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in all industries, including automotive, agriculture, mining, industrial automation and more. This roundtable will discuss: What it's going to take for industries to launch autonomous vehicles at scale; why industries like agriculture and manufacturing are seeking autonomous and software innovations from the automotive industry and robotics; the steps that must be taken to speed the delivery of the required software and algorithms; and the impact reliability has on autonomous vehicles. For example, if software crashes on your computer it is annoying, but on an autonomous car, farming equipment or manufacturing robot, the result can be devastating.\n\nAviation produced 2.4% of global CO emissions in 2018, which as a country would rank it sixth in the world (between Japan and Germany). Non-CO effects, such as warming induced by aircraft contrails and other pollutants, bring aviation's combined total contribution to global warming to approximately 5%. In this session, we will discuss the factors that have hindered zero-emission flight, as well as the technological roadmap and recent breakthrough innovations that will bring hydrogen-powered airplanes to the skies within the next few years.\n\nThis session will explore the opportunities mobility startups and companies have when building ethical and inclusive solutions into the infrastructure of their product, and/or company culture. We'll deep-dive into an \"AMA\" style and thoughtful discussion around innovating a multibillion-dollar industry with social innovation in mind. Sponsored by Wonder Women Tech.\n\nHealthcare's complex modes of transportation and chains of custody are in need of innovation. This session will offer a firsthand look at how two companies -- MediGO and MissionGO -- are currently leveraging autonomous unmanned helicopters to provide safe, efficient, inexpensive, and low carbon footprint transport of critical medical cargo. Participants will learn about and discuss ideas for addressing known and unknown scenarios in which decision-making will take place between autonomous and traditional modes of transportation, as well as ways to provide improved healthcare resource efficiencies (including delivery of blood samples and human transplant organs; healthy, fresh and local foods; and emergency supplies), improve patient outcomes and reduce costs.\n\nThe development of autonomous truck technology has progressed to a point where it's no longer a question of if, but how and when it will become commercially available at scale. Amisha Vadalia, Plus's Senior Director of Operations, will share the different paths companies are taking to develop Level 4 driverless trucks, Plus's unique evolutionary path to full autonomy, which starts with a commercial product already being being operated by Amazon and others, and a comparison of human-centered technology with systems that are not based on feedback from drivers, fleets and OEMs.\n\nMay 19\n\nThe capital markets have a way of distracting even the most scrappy founders. However, as we're starting to see, a well-priced funding round isn't a replacement for a well-oiled operation. And startups should think more about strategic opportunities, and collaborations, when giving up those coveted cap table spots. We're bringing together GM Ventures' John Du, Snow Bull Capital's Taylor Ogan and Intel Capital's Trina Van Pelt to talk about partnerships in the mobility world - especially the ones that you're probably not thinking about.\n\nLuminar founder and CEO Austin Russell has a different view of how to deploy autonomy at scale from other AV developers in the industry, as well as Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Lidar sits at the center of Russell's vision, but perhaps not in the way one might think. We'll dig into Russell's perspective and his strategy of how to bring autonomous vehicle to the masses at scale -- without pulling the human out of the driver's seat.\n\nRalph Gilles started at Chrysler in 1992, and he's still with the company as the Chief Design Officer at the newly-formed conglomerate, Stellantis. His design resume is legendary: The Chrysler 300C, Dodge Magnum, SRT Grand Cherokee, and the SRT Viper. But now he's leading Stellantis into the electric future, which requires (and allows) for radical new designs. Hear about his design process, and how he's reshaping the automobile yet again.\n\nIn anticipation of a future where autonomy is the norm and passengers will seek stimulating entertainment to break up the monotony of a commute, Holoride is offering an in-car VR system that turns every vehicle into a moving theme park. Only the Audi-spinoff isn't waiting for full autonomy to commercialize its product and bring us into the new passenger economy. Holoride's VR tech is coming to Audi cars as early as this summer. We'll sit down with Nils Wollny, co-founder and CEO of Holoride, to talk about what place VR, blockchain, NFTs and crypto currency have in the automotive space.\n\nA new era in connected cars is here, and with that comes new security risks. And then there are robotaxis and other autonomous vehicles. Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek, undisputed leaders in the cybersecurity industry, who both hold top security roles at GM-backed self-driving company Cruise, will join us to discuss the dynamic and rapidly changing realm of automotive cybersecurity.\n\nArrival announced last year plans to design and build an affordable, purpose-built electric vehicle for ride-hailing in partnership with Uber. Before the vehicle enters production in Q3 2023, Arrival will show it off here at TC Sessions: Mobility. Arrival President Avinash Rugoobur will talk about the process of designing and hopefully producing the vehicle, what the EV company is also working on and what may be right around the corner.\n\nDr. Jun Pei founded Cepton in 2016 with the vision of enabling safe, autonomous transportation for everyone. Hands-free, driveway to driveway - lidar promises to make this vision a reality, but only through scale. We'll hear from Dr. Pei on Cepton's journey to the industry's largest ADAS lidar series production award, and what it means for the future of mobility. We'll also hear from Dr. Pei on lidar's unique capabilities of adding certainty to perception, key considerations behind scaling lidar for everyday passenger cars and the timeless principles underlying Cepton's elegant invention.\n\nThe industry's brightest entrepreneurs will take the stage in front of a live audience and a panel of industry experts, pitching revolutionary technologies.\n\nThe future of mobility starts with the next generation of transportation solutions and the infrastructure that keeps them running safely and efficiently. Attendees will hear from some of the most innovative names on opportunities that await when the traditional auto industry collides with high-tech innovations to revolutionize the way we think about our roads. The session will illustrate the need for future-proofing our roads and how a connected and automated vehicle corridor in Michigan is paving the way for a nationwide deployment of tech-enabled roadway. The discussion will feature: Trevor Pawl, State of Michigan Chief Mobility Officer and Shelby Winkler, Senior Vice President of Programs and Operations at Cavnue\n\nWhen it comes to moving people via autonomous vehicles, two paths are beginning to emerge: Robotaxi services and private vehicles with autonomous capabilities. Companies are moving toward commercializing robotaxis by aiming straight for full autonomy. Automakers, on the other hand, are rolling out personal vehicles that have lower levels of autonomy via advanced driver assistance systems today, with the end goal of slowly improving until they can offer personal vehicles with higher levels of autonomous functionality. We'll sit down with the AV experts to discuss the stumbling blocks to each approach and which might deliver first at a mass scale.\n\nEverything about mobility is changing, from traditional public transit to ride sharing to a wave of electric vehicles, bikes, and scooters. New mobility requires more than just vehicles - we need on-site power, charging networks, digital platforms to manage fueling, maintenance, logistics, and more. Let's talk about the technology and market opportunities coming for a better, green transportation system. Sponsored by ProspectSV.\n\nEmerging economies like Lagos and Abuja, Nigeria, where Shuttlers operates, are famous for exponential population growth. This population growth comes with many challenges, transportation being one of the most prominent. The ever-growing population creates an imbalance where demand for transportation continues to outpace supply by miles. The United Nations (UN) has pointed out that high-technology-driven transportation systems that prioritize sustainability are the solution to common transportation problems in emerging economies. As private transport technology companies like Shuttlers emerge to redefine the way people move by introducing new tech-enabled transport systems and services, it is crucial to focus on long-term transportation sustainability. The conversation around transportation sustainability should focus on how technology can optimize these three key pillars: people, planet and profit.Discussing transportation sustainability at the roundtable (using the highlighted three Ps, also known as the triple-bottom-line model by John Elkington) will help raise awareness and offer solutions to the shortcomings of transportation technology in emerging markets. These shortcomings range from insufficient talent/skill to the issue of carbon emissions, unavailability of modern environmentally friendly transportation infrastructure and maintaining profitability as a startup whilst imbibing the best global practices in transport innovation.\n\nGas-powered cars and motorcycles have been around for more than 100 years. During that time, legacy auto brands and major corporations have gained a wealth of capital and experience in designing, manufacturing, selling and improving ICE models. Now with the push for electrification, that experience is a bit of a crutch. Electrification requires more than just adding a battery to existing ICE models, but a rethink of chassis designs and hard-tooled manufacturing facilities. Such a huge shift in mindset and expertise requires what tech startups have in spades -- this includes a penchant for constant innovation, failing fast and thinking beyond \"how things have been done\" for decades. Corporate America is learning from younger companies that are immersed in the world of electrification and working with the latest technology available. A huge reason why Sue went from being the CEO of Small Industrial Motors at GE to the CEO of Exro was because she couldn't innovate fast enough or take the amount of risk needed to change the industry from the inside. Sue will share how she now balances her corporate experience and profit-driven business savvy with her tech startup eagerness to move fast and break things to ultimately deliver EVs that drive better, faster and longer at a lower cost.\n\nEveryone -- from on-demand delivery to scooters to autonomous ridehailing -- needs a piece of the curb to operate. We'll talk about how smart cities are leveraging technology and platforms to manage and price this precious resource to deliver a safer, more sustainable mobility future.\n\nHead to TC Sessions: Mobility for a deeper dive into the future of transportation and to meet the people who are shaping it!

        title: "How Will Political And Economic Turmoil Impact Investment",
        body: "The Global Investor Conference (GIC) aims to tackle these tough questions and more next week in Portugal.\n\nThis year's Global Investor Conference offers investors and investment enthusiasts an opportunity to learn about the latest trends in private equity and venture investments. In addition, the conference lets clients and guests in on diverse perspectives that can nourish and strengthen their knowledge of global markets. This year's speakers are from Europe, the Americas, and Asia-Pacific (APAC).\n\nAs my global conference tour continues, I sat down with Karim Nurani, Chief Strategy Officer at the private equity investment firm Linqto about why this conference is critical in such a volatile business climate.\n\nInception and Vision\n\nThe Global Investor Conference started as an effort to bring what was happening in global markets to the attention of investors or startups.\n\nAccording to Nurani, the primary idea and goal behind the GIC was to \"tap the global environment, tap into the investors, the entrepreneurs, and the thought leaders to determine what they were building.\"\n\nEssentially, the GIC helped build a global environment where investors, entrepreneurs, and leaders of startups and established companies alike could interact. Unfortunately, investors often scout for investment opportunities in their local area. For instance, those based in California and looking to invest in artificial intelligence (AI) may not look beyond providers in the United States. To change this and improve the chances of potential unicorns being discovered and supported by the right investors, GIC was established on a global basis.\n\nAs Nurani noted, they worked to \"open up the platform, speak to people around the globe\" and eventually let entrepreneurs and investors know that they \"don't play in a little isolated environment.\" The main goal was to bring investors and entrepreneurs out of their local environments and into the global marketplace, thus widening the horizons and scaling the opportunities for all parties involved.\n\nLinqto wanted to make entrepreneurs and investors realize that a hundred other companies are trying to do what they're doing and that there are lessons to learn from each other. According to Nurani, \"the conference seeks to answer crucial questions: Are you picking necessarily the best company because they're in your geographical area? Maybe not. Are you looking outside your area and looking at the rest of the world, what's happening in Europe, what's happening in Asia, and Australia? Let's pay attention to that. So that was the Genesis of the Global Investor Conference -- to get a global viewpoint.\"\n\nIn their efforts to truly globalize the scope of the conference, Linqto ended up pioneering the discussions surrounding what are now well-known technologies. For example, the founding members of the GIC spoke to blockchain developers even before blockchain became popular; they discussed the metaverse before it was an established idea and NFTs before they became popular investments.\n\nThe main motive behind keeping the conference a virtual experience was to make it more accessible to a broader audience and have a broader panel of speakers from various industries across the globe. Coincidentally, the COVID-19 pandemic bred a growing interest in virtual programs, thus proving the effectiveness of their strategy. With global stakeholders across different sectors, all of whom with unique viewpoints, the conference became truly international in every aspect. It was also propelled to a unique position to discuss the market situation and help entrepreneurs and investors collaborate in their understanding of what the post-pandemic world would look like.\n\nThe Goal: Adding Value to Attendees\n\nEnabling deals, building connections, and promoting education, communication and partnership were the primary goals of the GIC.\n\nIn a vacuum, an individual company can only achieve so much on its own. In some cases, they may be deserving of an investment straight off the bat, while others may require some tweaking to reach their full potential. Optimizing a company's growth potential requires collaboration, as no single individual or board has all the answers. By exchanging ideas with accredited investors and fellow entrepreneurs, company leaders can be equipped with the knowledge, resources, and connections to secure investment.\n\n\"We don't pay the speakers; they all volunteer their time. We don't charge for an entrance into the Global Investor Conference; if you're an accredited investor or a learner or want to know more, that's where you come, and we don't charge for it,\" Nurani said. \"So, we had a lot of support from many speakers, many companies, and many investors, including venture companies and PE firms,\" he added.\n\nMichael Benoliel, CEO of the crowdsourced decentralized IoT network Nodle, reflects the feelings of the speakers and attendees of the event. \"We're looking forward to our participation in the Global Investor Conference 2022 event, which provides a unique opportunity to share and learn about some of the incoming disruptive technology in an environment that connects private investors with emerging industry trends and digital assets.\"\n\nWhy GIC Is Finally Offline and Why You Should Attend Although established as a virtual conference two years ago, the GIC will now be held as an in-person event in Lisbon, Portugal, from May 18 to 19, 2022.\n\n\"Considering the growing support for the conference and the fact that in-person gatherings were finally allowed again, hosting the GIC offline, in-person, felt like the ideal way to give back to the community that has loyally supported the conference in the past two years.\n\nAdditionally, virtual conferences have certain barriers as far as interaction and networking go. Hosting the conference offline or in a hybrid way is ideal for circumventing these hurdles and enabling attendees to interact freely and network. Beyond just professional enrichment, the experience of shaking hands and making eye contact as you exchange invaluable information, experiences, and insights with investors and fellow entrepreneurs was also a substantial motivating factor,\" stated Nurani.\n\n\"I've participated in several Linqto conferences, and they do a great job of bringing together thought leaders from both emerging startups as well as established pre-IPO companies - it's a unique showcase of the best entrepreneurs around the world working on the most interesting technologies, said Peter Loukianoff of Portal Venture Partners, which aligns influential investors with world-class entrepreneurs. I'm particularly impressed by their breadth and depth in the area of Web3.0, which like the Internet, cloud computing, and data analytics, will practically affect every business in the future.\"\n\nBased on everything going on in the markets and the world, this kind of conference and knowledge gathering is critical for investors and those seeking investment to understand what to expect in the coming year.",

          "Electric eels inspired the first battery two centuries ago and now point a way to future battery technologies",
        body: "Unlike current batteries, eels use biochemical processes to create and store electricity. Scientists hope to mimic eels to power medical implants and robots.\n\nAs the world's need for large amounts of portable energy grows at an , many innovators have sought to replace current battery technology with something better.\n\nItalian physicist tapped into fundamental electrochemical principles when he invented the first battery in 1800. Essentially, the physical joining of two different materials, usually metals, generates a chemical reaction that results in the flow of electrons from one material to the other. That stream of electrons represents portable energy that can be .\n\nThe first materials people employed to make batteries were copper and zinc. Today's best batteries -- those that produce the highest electrical output in the smallest possible size -- with one of several different metallic compounds.\n\nThere have been steady improvements over the centuries, but modern batteries rely on the same strategy as that of Volta: pair together materials that can generate an electrochemical reaction and snatch the electrons that are produced.\n\nBut as I describe in my book \",\" even before humanmade batteries started generating electric current, electric fishes, such as the saltwater torpedo fish () of the Mediterranean and especially the various freshwater electric eel species of South America (order ) were well known to produce electrical outputs of stunning proportions.\n\nIn fact, electric fishes inspired Volta to conduct the original research that ultimately led to his battery, and today's battery scientists still look to these electrifying animals for ideas.\n\nCopying the eel's electric organ\n\nPrior to Volta's battery, the only way for people to generate electricity was to rub various materials together, typically silk on glass, and to capture the resulting static electricity. This was neither an easy nor practical way to generate useful electrical power.\n\nVolta knew electric fishes had an internal organ specifically devoted to generating electricity. He reasoned that if he could mimic , he might be able to find a novel way to generate electricity.\n\nThe electric organ of a fish is composed of long stacks of cells that look very much like a roll of coins. So Volta cut out coinlike disks from sheets of various materials and started stacking them, in different sequences, to see if he could find any combination that would produce electricity. These stacking experiments kept yielding negative results until he tried pairing copper disks with zinc ones, while separating the stacked pairs with paper disks wetted with saltwater.\n\nThis sequence of copper-zinc-paper fortuitously produced electricity, and the electrical output was proportionate to the height of the stack. Volta thought he had uncovered the secret of how eels generate their electricity and that he had actually produced an artificial version of the electric organ of fish, so he initially called his discovery an \"artificial electric organ.\" But it was not.\n\nWhat really makes eels electrifying\n\nScientists now know the between dissimilar materials that Volta discovered have nothing to do with the way an electric eel generates its electricity. Rather, the eel uses an approach similar to the way our nerve cells generate their electrical signals, but on a much grander scale.\n\nSpecialized cells within the eel's electric organ pump ions across a semipermeable membrane barrier to produce an electrical charge difference between the inside versus the outside of the membrane. When microscopic gates in the membrane open, the rapid flow of ions from one side of the membrane to the other generates an electrical current.\n\nThe eel is able to at will to generate a huge jolt of electricity, which it unleashes in a targeted fashion upon its prey.\n\nElectric eels don't shock their prey to death; they just it before attacking. An eel can generate hundreds of volts of electricity (American household outlets are 110 volts), but the eel's voltage does not push enough current (amperage), for a long enough time, to kill. Each electric pulse from an eel lasts only a couple thousandths of a second and delivers less than 1 amp. That's just 5% of household amperage.\n\nThis is similar to how electric fences work, delivering very short pulses of high-voltage electricity, but with very low amperage. They thus shock but do not kill bears or other animal intruders that try to get through them. It is also similar to a modern , which works by quickly delivering an extremely high-voltage pulse (about 50,000 volts) carrying very low amperage (just a few milliamps).\n\nModern attempts to mimic the eel\n\nLike Volta, some modern electrical scientists searching to transform battery technology find their inspiration in electric eels.\n\nA team of scientists from the United States and Switzerland is currently . They envision that their soft and flexible battery might someday be useful for internally powering medical implants and soft robots. But the team admits they have a long way to go.\n\n\"The electric organs in eels are incredibly sophisticated; they're far better at generating power than we are,\" lamented , a team member from the University of Fribourg. So, the eel research continues.\n\nIn 2019, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to the three scientists who . In conferring the award, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences asserted that the awardees' work had \".\"\n\nThe \"wireless\" part is definitely true, since lithium-ion batteries now power virtually all hand-held wireless devices. We'll have to wait and see about the \"fossil fuel-free society\" claim, because today's lithium-ion batteries are recharged with electricity often generated by burning fossil fuels. No mention was made of the contributions of electric eels.\n\nLater that same year, though, scientists from the Smithsonian Institution announced their ; this one is notably the strongest known bioelectricity generator on Earth. Researchers recorded the electrical discharge of a single eel at 860 volts, well above that of the previous record-holding eel species, , that clocked in at 650 volts, and 200-fold higher that the top voltage of a single lithium-ion battery (4.2 volts).\n\nJust as we humans try to congratulate ourselves on the greatness of our latest portable energy source, the electric eels continue to humble us with theirs.\n\nis director of the health physics and radiation protection graduate program and professor of radiation medicine at Georgetown University\n\nThis commentary was originally published by The Conversation -\n\nMore evidence-based commentary",

        title: "Explaining The Art Behind The Forbes AI 50 Design",
        body: "hen tasked with creating the art for the fourth annual Forbes AI 50 list, it immediately struck me that we should use Artificial Intelligence to generate our deliverable. AI is making considerable strides not only in commercial applications, but in visual art as well. Its artistic endeavors are being auctioned at Sotheby's, generating NFT collections, and expediting traditional production processes across media. What does this mean for the future of art, and its reception by the general public?\n\nIn most cases for artificially intelligent visual work, such as the main art for AI 50, a General Adversarial Network, or GAN, is \"trained\" on a large dataset and compares the individual relationships between each instance of data to understand what belongs and what doesn't. The GAN slowly learns to filter out noise in that data, revealing the similarities, and finally achieving the ability to recreate the material received or to determine whether or not a new input matches it. It's the same machine learning process that goes into loan approval automation or public health diagnostics, the main differences being the end goal and the dataset used. Once trained, the GAN's knowledge is contained in a matrix of vectors, referred to as a \"latent space.\" The art you are viewing is a composite of 4 separate \"latent spacewalks,\" trained using two ready-made datasets provided by Runway ML, and two that were hand-curated by Forbes staff. We \"walked\" through the matrix, each step resulting in a frame of a video.\n\nI find this process enjoyable because it renders any single output of the GAN less interesting than a sequence of them. My goal is to engage audiences with art in a dynamic format that is reliant on time and systemic relationships beyond the static perfection of a framed painting or statue. Rather than objects made to create an aesthetic experience and hold value, I like to think of art as a momentary output of artists' practices, which are living, breathing, often focused not just on form but on investigation of the world. It's more than giving the viewer a feel-something moment, though that's great. It's also meant to spur thought, influence opinion, and ultimately affect change. This activity is dynamic, purposely fuzzy, ill-defined, loose and inviting serendipitous meanderings and forking pursuits. It generates turbulence and optimistically criticizes, inviting you to do the same.\n\nIn the turbulence of this dynamism, there's something else to realize: the so-called author of a work of AI art is no longer a lone creator. The AI, plus the sources of its training material, is her (often unpredictable) partner. Designers and artists have long discussed the idea of programmatic co-creation, see Sol Lewitt's Wall Drawings or the Conditional Design Manifesto. But the impending widespread utility of artificial intelligence is going to bring this spirit of collaboration further into the mainstream. Everyone and no one can be a creator, and that's great! It comes at a moment historically pivotal for other reasons that bear the need for collaborative spirit, such as climate change and the reframing of peaceful globalism in the face of a resurging Cold War. The idea of domination has to go away: it is time to rewild, reunite, and return to traditions of communal and ecological reciprocity that we have lost sight of. Although AI is high-tech, and can certainly be used for evil, it has the potential to reinvigorate organic relationships that are essential to a sustainable future. By no means do I see what we've made as very pretty or refined, but maybe that shouldn't be the point anymore.\n\nLet's also take a moment to explore the idea of refinement in AI as it relates to kitsch and ingenuity. Researchers measure the accuracy of a GAN using a metric called the Fréchet Inception Distance, or FID, which basically quantifies the accuracy of the GAN's output in relation to the data it was trained with. If you want to make a GAN that generates, say, leaf blowers, the lower the FID, the more realistic the leaf blower. If we tried to do this in art, we would immediately arrive at kitsch; it's just a thoughtless reiteration of something preexistent. That's the difficulty in creating something meaningful with AI -- if it's too accurate it's meaningless, and if it's too ambiguous it's meaningless again (and yes, swirling images that make buildings look like dogs, Van Goghs or cheese balls almost always fall into the first extreme of this meaninglessness spectrum). Not to mention, it's pretty hard to find 5000 images of something, and harder still to curate those images in a way that isn't betrayed by the limitations, and underlying discriminations, of humanity's image-making apparatus. For example, we used a series of images capturing well-designed industrial products for one component of the illustration, and I question if it only results in a kitschy pastiche that reinforces the heuristics of that field, as opposed to investigating the universal structures governing them, and profoundly winding the world into a moment. It's critical that as GANs are adopted by the public we avoid setting off on the wrong path. Look around you, what meaning is embedded in the built environment? How are you interacting with the cumulative expression of society?\n\nUltimately, we will forever continue fusing disciplines into others and discovering the intersectionality of our existence. Art will become a tool and tools will become art and hopefully, at some point soon, decentralization will shift the responsibility of creation and design away from a technocratic few to the cooperative many. When that happens, it will be more important than ever for us to define what's essential to sustaining our lives. I would like to think they will be filled with individuality, curiosity, accountability and optimism.",

        title: "The Crypto Winter Is Here",
        body: "Bloomberg Webinars: Access a broad range of analysis, research, insight & ideas.\n\nHi, it's Ed Harrison and I write about markets and policy for Bloomberg's Markets Live. This is The Everything Risk, where each week I'll unpack the web of risks for consumers and investors in a shifting markets landscape.\n\nLast Wednesday, when I first started thinking about writing about cyrptocurrencies, Bitcoin was trading near $40,000. As of late Monday, it was at its lowest level since July 2021, trading below $30,000 before slightly bouncing back along with equities. Bitcoin is now more correlated with the Nasdaq than at any time since 2010, closely mirroring tech stocks as they keep crashing. Right now, crypto simply can't be considered the kind of portfolio-diversifying asset class that lowers risk and increases returns as some advocates describe it.\n\nInstead, crypto has increasingly become an arena for speculation, often dominated by those looking to make a quick buck. As the Federal Reserve tightens policy, the whole crypto space is following high-beta equities lower amid rising interest rates. It's a matter of time before greater losses materialize due to speculators leaving the space even as faithful crypto enthusiasts hold (or HODL) onto their coins. That means we're at the start of another crypto winter.\n\nIn the history of cyrptocurrencies there have been two main episodes of major crashes known as \"crypto winters.\" I remember the first one most memorably, because as Bitcoin took a dive in 2014, I wrote a newsletter post advocating Walmart create its own crypto scrip using the blockchain to increase its employees' paycheck. The value of Bitcoin, which had peaked at $1,137 in November 2013 had already fallen to $786 by the time I was talking Walbucks. Ultimately, Bitcoin fell to $183 -- or almost 84% -- before it started its second meteoric rise, beginning in 2015. That's quite a stunning decline.\n\nWith Bitcoin trading above $30,000 just seven years later, one could reasonably conclude that holding on for dear live, or HODLing, through a decline is the right way to go. I'm not so sure. Bitcoin is not a useful payments platform because it's too slow for that. It's mostly a store of value, an alternative to other forms of money. And there are other cryptocurrencies for which people are developing services and ecosystems where one can exchange goods. It's still uncertain that Bitcoin will be a long-term winner -- or which other cryptocurrencies will prevail.\n\nBefore we talk about price action, let's back up a second and talk about why cryptocurrencies have any value at all. One reason I was attracted to the crypto space early on was because I recognized the blockchain as allowing value to be transferred digitally more seamlessly without the active intervention of a bank or payments processor. So you can think of every cryptocurrency as a platform or ecosystem where people can buy goods or services, give gifts, and generally exchange value of any amount for any reason. The value of the cryptocurrency is embedded within the ecosystem via the size of the network and the amount of value that can be exchanged.\n\nFor example, in my 2014 Walmart hypothetical, Walbucks were a specific form of digital money, or credit usable only in Walmart stores. Since Walmart was the largest U.S. employer with 2014 revenue just shy of $500 billion, there would be plenty of opportunity to exchange value.\n\nSo, a cryptocurrency as an idea makes sense. Given how vast the Internet is and how fast network connections are, the world is ripe for a wholesale digitization of value, with value transfer moving almost entirely to digital form. The big barrier is trust. Sure, I am going to make a digital transfer to my local utility via my bank because I know who my utility is and I trust my bank's payment platform. But I'm not going to send hundreds of dollars to someone halfway around the world for a good or service unless I know I will get what I'm paying for. That's exactly why the digital payment processor PayPal made a great acquisition for eBay in 2002, when it was growing like crazy and its shares were bucking the Internet bust.\n\nStill, as I put it last year, \"The virtual world has a trust problem and crypto is about eliminating that trust problem.\" In describing Elon Musk's proposed acquisition of Twitter, my colleague Eddie van der Walt described how crypto could help this way:\n\nWe could finally have digital identities as immutable as our own that are controlled and owned by neither state nor private business but exist on a decentralized blockchain...You ask for my contact details. I give you a QR code. Suddenly we're connected across all platforms I choose to share with you. And if you annoy me -- I simply revoke your permissions.\n\nThat can all happen without the intervention of governments, Twitter, Facebook or anyone else but you. There's value in services like that. So crypto could be used for value transfer in both goods and services.\n\nHere's the problem. Any time you have a new, new thing, everyone is falling all over themselves to get into that space. I'm as guilty as anyone. I left the banking industry to chase an Internet-related career just as the tech bubble was bursting in 2000.\n\nBut torrid periods like that simply mean a spectacular bust is virtually guaranteed. I'm not talking about fraud -- though there's sure to be a lot of that. I'm talking about a frenzy, a land grab, where well-intentioned individuals are competing to become leaders in the next space of technological displacement while that leadership is still up for grabs.\n\nWhile the shakeout between the crypto equivalents of Friendster, Facebook and MySpace is underway, neither you nor I know who's going to be the ultimate winner. You could place bets on your favorite. Or you could place bets on a portfolio of all of them to ensure a reasonable return. But the reality is that network effects in the digital world and in the payments space are high. Eventually, only a few players will dominate and the rest will fade into oblivion -- as will the value of their cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis is a process that leads to high volatility, rampant speculation, inflated values and eventually, a spectacular bust as the shakeout occurs before everything settles at a fair value.\n\nWhen you have the world's leading central bank promising to raise interest rates in half-point jumps until it brings inflation -- and the economy -- to heal, that's a good time to exit your most speculative positions. For crypto as an asset class, that's bad news and already visible in a simple price chart. Rather than acting as an inflation hedge, Bitcoin has been dropping in line with other interest-rate sensitive assets.\n\nIn the early spring of 2021 it peaked above 63,000 when the highest-duration equities were peaking. Why? Because that's when the Treasury yield curve started to flatten due to an anticipation of weaker growth from the Fed normalizing monetary policy.\n\nThe Fed relented though. It told us that inflation would be transitory. And speculative investment returned. While the most speculative shares didn't go back to all-time highs, crypto did hit new highs. And there was a widespread feeling that a crypto winter had been averted.\n\nThat ended, however, in November when the Fed indicated it would start tapering its quantitative-easing bond buying. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has sold off more than 25% since then. And crypto has suffered too. The Fed is now on track to raise rates by a full percentage point in the next two months. That's a headwind for equities and especially bad for crypto.\n\nThere's one other thing that makes crypto vulnerable. It's a techie 'law' attributed to engineer Robert Metcalfe which says that the value of a digital network is proportional to the square of the number of users connected by the ecosystem. It could be lower than that or higher, depending on the circumstances. But the overriding sense is that the size of the network is hugely important because of the exponential nature of value size.\n\nIn good times, that's why you see these big surges. Metcalfe's law would tell you a network of 1,000,000 people is worth worth 1 million times a network of 1,000 people. So if you grow your network really, really fast, even losing money in the process and get all the users on your network, once you start monetizing that network, it's a veritable torrent of free cash flow. Just ask Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nBut there's a problem. If the Fed is hammering high-beta stocks and crypto and driving out the speculative players, they are de facto shrinking your network. And if they're shrinking your network, then they're not just shrinking the value of your network, they're massively shrinking it. Metcalfe's Law. That makes a crypto winter all but inevitable.\n\nSo, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which have no inherent value, could fall a long way if their networks are sharply reduced. We've seen many turbo-charged tech stocks lose over three-quarters of their value in the last 15 months. For Bitcoin, which peaked at near $68,000, that kind of downturn would mean losses of almost 50% from here. And it's hard to justify holding onto an asset through that kind of decline unless you are a true believer.\n\nAt some point the speculators will take a back seat. And the only people left in the space will be those who are deriving value from goods and services transfers and those who intend to hold cryptocurrency as a store of value for the long-term. But what will the crypto ecosystem look like when the bloodletting is over? I suspect some cryptocurrencies will be worthless and that capital investment in the space will slow to a crawl as investors nurse their losses, much as we saw in the Internet bubble. And that may make another leap up in price more difficult this time around. The next leap in value for those that do survive or new players that emerge should prove more viable and long-lasting as long as it's driven by realistic fundamentals and a loyal network. It won't be a leap to the moon without the speculative fervor, but a slower and steadier growth would be more long lasting.",
